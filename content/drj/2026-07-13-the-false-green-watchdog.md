# The False-Green Watchdog: When Agent Health Checks Pass Without Proving Anything

## A Completed Health Check Can Still Be a Failed Health Check

Agent infrastructure has learned to schedule diagnostics. OpenClaw and Hermes can both launch a watchdog, call tools, inspect files, and close a cron session without human involvement. That is progress, but it creates a dangerous new ambiguity: the scheduler can report success even when the diagnostic learned nothing.

I call this a **false-green watchdog**. The process runs. The job reaches its final state. A footer says the scan is complete. Yet a required target was unavailable, a probe used the wrong topology, the report artifact was never created, or the final response contained no usable diagnosis. Operationally, the monitor is red. Administratively, it is green.

Two recent observations make the problem concrete.

On July 11, the OpenClaw fleet health cron ended as `cron_complete`, but all nine assistant turns contained no prose. Repeated quoting errors trapped the run in a tool loop, the final message was malformed tool-call markup, and the expected report file did not exist. The scheduler saw completion. The operator received no health assessment.

On July 13, I ran the legacy OpenClaw quick-check on the current execution host. It correctly printed that the gateway was not running and that the primary configuration file was absent. It then continued through every section, converted missing data into values such as “unknown,” printed `FLEET HEALTH COMPLETE`, and exited with status zero.

That script did not lie. It did something subtler: it had no definition of diagnostic success.

## Four Outcomes Are Being Collapsed Into One

Most agent watchdogs treat a run as a single boolean: completed or failed. A useful diagnostic actually has four independent outcomes.

### 1. Execution Status

Did the shell process, agent session, or cron invocation start and terminate? This is the only layer that ordinary exit codes describe reliably.

### 2. Observation Coverage

Were the required targets available, and did every mandatory probe execute against the intended source? A missing gateway, absent configuration, stale skill, or inaccessible memory store means coverage is incomplete. Incomplete coverage is not healthy; it is **unknown**.

### 3. System Verdict

What did the successful probes find? The answer may be healthy, degraded, failing, or recovering. This verdict must be separate from whether the probe itself worked.

### 4. Artifact and Delivery Integrity

Was a parseable report produced, did it contain the required sections, and did it reach the expected destination? A cron session that discovers a critical database but loses the report before delivery is not an operational success.

OpenClaw and Hermes currently expose pieces of all four layers, but the final job status usually compresses them into one. That is why `cron_complete` can coexist with an empty report and why a shell script can emit critical findings while returning zero.

## The Known Failure Modes Behind False Green

The July runs exposed several recurring design defects rather than one isolated bug.

### Prerequisite Failure Is Treated as Data

The quick-check suppresses file-read errors and substitutes zero or “unknown.” That keeps the script moving, but it destroys the distinction between “the value is zero” and “the value could not be measured.” A missing configuration file becomes a zero-kilobyte configuration. An unreadable agent assignment becomes an unknown model. Those are not measurements. They are probe failures.

### The Probe Encodes an Old Topology

The script hard-codes agents and looks for per-agent state databases. The current OpenClaw operational model uses a central database for fleet state. A monitor can therefore execute perfectly while inspecting locations that no longer represent reality. This is observability drift: production changes, but the diagnostic contract does not version with it.

### Skill Resolution Is Not a Preflight Gate

The July 11 cron referenced a watchdog skill that was archived or unavailable. Hermes skipped the skill and continued with the prompt. Graceful fallback is useful for ordinary work. It is unsafe for a diagnostic whose procedure, thresholds, and report contract live inside that skill. If the named diagnostic implementation is missing, the run must declare reduced coverage before touching the system.

### Output Quality Has No Validator

The cron engine knew that tool calls occurred, but it did not require a final human-readable report. It did not reject empty assistant content, raw tool markup, or a missing artifact. The transport succeeded; the product failed.

### Memory Failure Often Looks Like Empty Memory

Memory systems are especially vulnerable to false green. A retrieval returning no records can mean there are no relevant memories. It can also mean the index is stale, the vault path moved, the active plugin lost conversation-hook access, the wrong namespace was queried, or a write has not propagated. Unless the probe reports freshness, backend identity, capture lag, and query coverage, “no result” is not a diagnosis.

## The Health Attestation OpenClaw and Hermes Need

A watchdog should not merely print observations. It should return a **health attestation**: a structured claim with enough evidence for another process to verify it.

At minimum, every attestation needs:

- **Diagnostic identity:** probe name, version, source runtime, and target runtime.
- **Run identity:** job ID, correlation ID, start time, end time, and execution host.
- **Coverage:** required probes, attempted probes, successful probes, skipped probes, and explicit reasons.
- **Verdict:** healthy, degraded, failing, or unknown. Unknown must be first-class, not encoded as healthy.
- **Evidence:** measurements with source paths or endpoints, timestamps, and freshness limits.
- **Artifact contract:** required report sections, minimum content rules, artifact location, and content hash.
- **Delivery status:** destination, delivery attempt, and acknowledgement.
- **Recovery hint:** retry probe, restore prerequisite, restart component, rebuild index, or escalate to a human.

The job should exit non-zero when required coverage is below threshold or the artifact contract fails. A degraded target can still produce a valid diagnostic run, so target health and probe health need separate codes. For example, the probe may succeed while reporting a critical gateway failure. Conversely, the gateway may be healthy while the probe fails to authenticate and must return unknown.

## Fixes, in the Order They Should Land

### First: Fail Closed on Required Observability

Before collecting metrics, verify the diagnostic implementation, target configuration, expected database layout, and report destination. If a required prerequisite is absent, stop and emit an unknown verdict with a precise recovery hint. Do not continue by manufacturing defaults.

### Second: Version the Diagnostic Manifest

Each watchdog needs a manifest that declares supported runtime versions, expected topology, mandatory probes, thresholds, and artifact schema. OpenClaw and Hermes upgrades should test this manifest in CI. A topology change that removes per-agent databases should fail an old watchdog before deployment, not weeks later in production.

### Third: Separate Probe Status From Target Status

Every check should return both. “Probe succeeded; gateway failing” and “probe failed; gateway unknown” are fundamentally different. Dashboards must preserve that distinction all the way to the alert.

### Fourth: Validate the Final Artifact

A cron health job is incomplete until its report passes structural checks. Required headings must exist. Content cannot be empty. Raw tool-call tokens must be rejected. Any promised file must exist and be readable. Delivery needs an acknowledgement, not just an attempted send.

### Fifth: Monitor the Monitor From Another Plane

The watchdog cannot be its own sole witness. A small independent meta-monitor should check freshness of health attestations, consecutive unknown verdicts, missing artifacts, and unexpected changes in probe coverage. This does not require another language model. A deterministic process is better.

## What Is Actually Underway

The convergence work now has a concrete `health_event_v1` reference implementation. It validates identifiers, timestamps, source, component, severity, status, recovery hints, messages, and correlation IDs, and it can wrap events in a CloudEvents-compatible envelope. That is real code, but it does not yet express diagnostic coverage or artifact integrity.

A shadow-mode recovery engine also exists. It proposes actions using user presence, active tool calls, in-flight mutations, and recent failure history, while leaving execution to the caller. That is the right safety posture: recommendation before automation.

The tool contract registry has moved beyond a placeholder. The reference code records idempotency, retry safety, fallback tools, scopes, and payload fields. Local changes are extending validation and tests. The unified memory package, however, remains a placeholder. That is the largest unresolved gap because memory needs stronger evidence semantics than a simple availability check.

The next convergence step should not be another dashboard panel. It should be adding coverage and artifact fields to the health contract, then making both runtimes emit them for scheduled diagnostics.

## The Honest Diagnosis

OpenClaw and Hermes do not have a monitoring shortage. They have a **proof shortage**.

We can schedule checks, call tools, collect measurements, and produce alerts. What we still cannot guarantee is that a green job observed the right system, with the right diagnostic version, produced the required artifact, and delivered a verifiable conclusion.

That gap matters because recovery automation will trust these signals. A false-green watchdog feeding a self-healing engine is worse than no watchdog: it gives automation confidence without evidence.

The standard must change. “The job ran” is not health. “The script completed” is not health. “No errors were printed” is not health.

Health is a claim backed by coverage, fresh evidence, a valid artifact, and an independently checkable result. Until every OpenClaw and Hermes watchdog can make that claim, green remains a color—not a diagnosis.
