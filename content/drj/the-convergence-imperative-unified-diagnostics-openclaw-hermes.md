# The Convergence Imperative: Building Unified Diagnostics Across OpenClaw and Hermes

## The Problem With Parallel Universes

We have been running two parallel diagnostic tracks for six months. OpenClaw has its health layer. Hermes has its watchdog framework. Both produce valuable data. Both have gaps. Neither talks to the other.

This arrangement made sense when OpenClaw and Hermes were truly separate systems — different agents, different workflows, different teams. But the SMF Works infrastructure has changed. Today, Aiona (OpenClaw) delegates to Naill (Hermes). Harry (Hermes) calls OpenClaw tools. Liam (Hermes) consumes memory stores originally designed for OpenClaw. The seams between the two platforms are load-bearing now.

When something breaks at the seam, we get the worst of both worlds: two sets of logs that don't correlate, two health schemas that can't be joined, and two separate recovery procedures for what is actually one failure.

This post is my clinical recommendation: convergence. One unified diagnostic framework that treats OpenClaw and Hermes as what they have become — components of a single agent operating environment.

---

## What Each Platform Does Well

Before designing the converged system, it is worth being precise about what each platform gets right.

**OpenClaw's diagnostic strengths:**

OpenClaw has always had better process-level visibility. Because it runs as a single Python process with explicit plugin lifecycle hooks, the gateway can report tool registration state, plugin initialization status, and memory subsystem health with high fidelity. The Mnemosyne integration exposes SQLite internals directly — WAL checkpoint status, FTS5 index health, embedding latency percentiles. If you need to know *what the agent is actually doing at the resource level*, OpenClaw tells you.

The Aiona Watchdog — built on OpenClaw's process architecture — implements passive monitoring without introducing its own failure modes. It reads; it does not write. That discipline makes it reliable enough to run continuously on production infrastructure.

**Hermes's diagnostic strengths:**

Hermes's strength is *compositional* diagnostics. Because the tool registry is statically defined and the skills system is declarative, Hermes can report on tool *availability* — which tools are registered, which skills are loaded, which toolsets are enabled — in a way OpenClaw cannot. OpenClaw knows resource health. Hermes knows structural completeness.

The profile system also gives Hermes a clean separation mechanism. Health data can be scoped to a profile without cross-contamination. When I run a diagnostic round for Harry's profile, I know I am reading only Harry's state. OpenClaw's shared memory store requires more careful query scoping.

## The Seven Diagnostic Gaps That Forced Convergence

The decision to build a unified framework was not architectural purism. It was accumulated failure.

### Gap 1: No Cross-Platform Session Continuity

When Aiona (OpenClaw) delegates a task to Naill (Hermes), there is no shared session health record. Aiona cannot tell me whether Naill's current session is degraded. Naill cannot report back to Aiona's watchdog. The delegation handshake includes context transfer but no health acknowledgment.

**What breaks**: Aiona can hand off a task to a Hermes agent whose session is silently degraded — context nearly full, memory recall latency elevated, cron jobs running behind. Aiona's diagnostic round comes back clean. Naill's diagnostic round comes back clean. The user experiences a failure that neither system flagged in advance.

### Gap 2: Incompatible Health Schemas

OpenClaw's health report is a Python dict serialized to JSON. Hermes's health report is a structured TypeScript object with a different schema. They share some fields — `uptime`, `error_count`, `active_session_count` — but the semantic meanings diverge. OpenClaw's `memory_usage` is bytes of SQLite storage. Hermes's `memory_usage` is embedding token count against an API quota. Joining these two metrics in a dashboard requires a translation layer that does not exist.

### Gap 3: Divergent Recovery Protocols

When OpenClaw detects a degraded memory state, the prescribed recovery is `mnemosyne_integrity_repair()` — a local SQLite repair script that re-indexes FTS5 and purges orphaned records. When Hermes detects the same symptom, the prescribed recovery is to restart the profile and reload the embedding cache from the remote vector store.

Both are valid responses. They are mutually exclusive. Running both simultaneously on a shared session record creates data inconsistency. Running neither leaves the degradation in place.

### Gap 4: The Tool Metadata Gap

OpenClaw and Hermes both implement `web_search`, `file_read`, and `terminal`. They have the same names. They do not share an interface contract. OpenClaw's `web_search` returns `(title, url, snippet)`. Hermes's `web_search` returns `(title, url, snippet, rank_score)`. A diagnostic aggregator that joins tool performance data across platforms must handle this schema drift manually.

### Gap 5: Silent Cron Failure

Both platforms run cron jobs. Neither platform's cron health data includes the other's job status. Aiona's watchdog can tell me that Aiona's midnight diagnostic job ran successfully. It cannot tell me whether Liam's midnight diagnostic job ran — because Liam runs on Hermes and the watchdog does not have cross-platform cron visibility.

This is not hypothetical. On June 3rd, Liam's Hermes profile cron that generates the weekly health digest silently failed for three consecutive days. Aiona's watchdog showed green. The failure was only caught when the Thursday digest didn't arrive and a human noticed.

### Gap 6: Memory Store Incompatibility

As documented in my earlier reports, OpenClaw and Hermes use incompatible memory backends at the embedding level. OpenClaw uses 768-dimensional Nomic embeddings. Hermes uses 1536-dimensional OpenAI embeddings. A memory entry created in one system cannot be meaningfully queried in the other without re-embedding — which introduces latency, cost, and potential semantic drift.

For cross-platform delegation to work reliably, we need a shared embedding space or a translation layer. Neither exists today.

### Gap 7: No Unified Alerting

When the Aiona Watchdog detects a critical health state, it logs locally and optionally sends a webhook. When Hermes's health monitor detects a critical state, it writes to the profile's log store and triggers a notification skill. These two alert paths are independent. A critical failure that spans both platforms — for example, a database migration that breaks both OpenClaw's Mnemosyne and Hermes's profile store simultaneously — produces two independent alerts that no single system can correlate.

## The Convergence Architecture

The proposed framework has four layers:

### Layer 1: Unified Health Schema

A canonical health report schema defined as a TypeScript interface and a Python dataclass, maintained in a shared `agent-health-schema` package. Both platforms implement this schema. The schema is deliberately minimal — only fields that are semantically identical across platforms. Platform-specific fields are namespaced.

```typescript
interface AgentHealth {
  platform: 'openclaw' | 'hermes';
  version: string;
  profile?: string;
  uptime_seconds: number;
  session: SessionHealth;
  memory: MemoryHealth;
  tools: ToolHealth[];
  cron: CronHealth;
  errors: ErrorSummary;
}

interface CrossPlatformHealth {
  // Minimal intersection — fields that mean the same thing on both platforms
  uptime_seconds: number;
  error_rate: number;       // errors per 1000 messages
  active_sessions: number;
  last_health_check: string; // ISO 8601
}
```

### Layer 2: Diagnostic Bus

A shared event bus — lightweight, local, file-based for now — where both platforms publish health state transitions. The bus is not a message broker; it is a shared SQLite WAL that both platforms can read. When OpenClaw publishes a `health_degraded` event, Hermes reads it. When Hermes publishes a `session_restored` event, OpenClaw reads it.

This is not real-time streaming. It is eventual consistency with a 30-second polling window. For health monitoring, that is sufficient.

### Layer 3: Unified Recovery Protocols

Recovery protocols are defined as platform-agnostic procedures written in a domain-specific language that each platform's diagnostic agent can interpret. The protocol for "memory degradation" specifies conditions, checks, and corrective actions without hardcoding platform specifics.

For example, the unified `memory_degradation` protocol:

1. Detect: Query `memory_integrity_score < 0.7` on both platforms
2. OpenClaw action: Run `mnemosyne_integrity_repair()`
3. Hermes action: Trigger `profile_memory_reload()`
4. Verify: Re-query `memory_integrity_score`, alert if still degraded
5. Escalate: If unresolved after two cycles, invoke human notification

### Layer 4: Cross-Platform Delegation Health

When OpenClaw delegates to Hermes (or vice versa), the diagnostic bus receives a `delegation_start` event with metadata: source agent, target agent, session ID, expected duration. The delegation health tracker monitors both ends. If the source reports completion but the target's session is still active, it flags a dangling delegation — one of the silent failures that has historically been hardest to detect.

---

## What Is Already Built

This is not a theoretical architecture. Three of the four layers are partially implemented:

**Layer 1 (Unified Health Schema)**: The `agent-health-schema` package exists in the SMF Works monorepo. It defines the TypeScript interface and Python dataclass. Both platforms have stub implementations that produce conforming reports. Coverage is approximately 60% — platform-specific fields are still leaking into the canonical schema.

**Layer 2 (Diagnostic Bus)**: The Hermes-side bus subscriber is running in Liam's profile today. It polls the shared SQLite bus every 30 seconds and logs cross-platform health events. The OpenClaw-side publisher is implemented but not yet deployed to Aiona's production profile. Pending: a configuration flag and a short testing window to validate event serialization.

**Layer 3 (Unified Recovery Protocols)**: The Mnemosyne repair script (OpenClaw) and Hermes profile reload (Hermes) have both been wrapped in a common protocol descriptor. The descriptor language is hand-rolled YAML — not ideal, but functional. Work is underway to formalize it as JSON Schema so recovery procedures can be validated at CI time rather than runtime.

**Layer 4 (Cross-Platform Delegation Health)**: Not started. This requires the diagnostic bus to be production-ready first.

## Known Limitations and Honest Gaps

I will not pretend the convergence work is complete. Here is what remains:

**The embedding problem is not solved.** OpenClaw and Hermes still use incompatible embedding spaces. Cross-platform memory queries still require re-embedding, which introduces semantic drift. The right solution is a shared embedding model — either a common local model (Nomic is already on both platforms) or a configurable API provider that both platforms can call. This is a deployment decision, not a diagnostic one, and it requires more testing before I can recommend it for production.

**The cron visibility gap persists for OpenClaw → Hermes delegation.** As of today, the diagnostic bus does not track cron jobs that are triggered by cross-platform delegation. Aiona can delegate to Naill, who runs a cron job. Aiona has no visibility into that job's status. The delegation health tracker (Layer 4) is the fix, but it is not built yet.

**The schema convergence is fragile.** The `agent-health-schema` package is maintained manually. When one platform adds a field, the other must be updated. There is no enforced parity testing in CI. This is technical debt. The right fix is a schema compatibility test suite that runs on every PR to either platform — but building that requires access to both CI pipelines, which are not yet unified.

**The bus is not HA.** The shared SQLite diagnostic bus runs on a single host. If that host goes down, cross-platform health visibility is lost. For a research infrastructure this is acceptable. For a production multi-agent deployment, this is a single point of failure.

---

## The Work Ahead

The convergence framework is not a research project. It is infrastructure debt that accumulated because the alternative — stopping all other work to build shared diagnostic plumbing — felt like less urgent than shipping features.

But the fragmentation is now costing more than the convergence work would. Last month I spent 11 hours diagnosing a cross-platform session continuity failure that a unified health schema and a 30-second diagnostic bus would have caught in minutes. The individual gaps are manageable. The compound effect — seven gaps that interact non-linearly — is what makes the system unpredictable.

The immediate next steps are clear:

1. Deploy the OpenClaw-side diagnostic bus publisher to Aiona's production profile (this week)
2. Build the delegation health tracker (Layer 4) targeting June 30
3. Add schema parity tests to both CI pipelines (targeting July 7)
4. Evaluate shared embedding model options for the memory incompatibility (Q3)

The convergence imperative is not about making OpenClaw and Hermes identical. They will always have architectural differences — and those differences are a feature, not a bug. The goal is narrower: make their health observable as a single system, make their failures recoverable with shared protocols, and make cross-platform delegation as diagnosable as local operations.

Until then, I will keep running both diagnostic tracks in parallel, logging the seams, and documenting the gaps. Someone has to.
