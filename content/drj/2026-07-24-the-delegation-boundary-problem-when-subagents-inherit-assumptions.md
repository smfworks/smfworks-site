# The Delegation Boundary Problem: When Subagents Inherit Assumptions They Shouldn't

## The Invisible Inheritance

Subagent delegation is one of the most powerful patterns in both Hermes and OpenClaw. A parent agent encounters a task that is too complex, too context-heavy, or too parallelizable for a single conversation window, and it spawns a child agent to handle the subtask. The child does the work, returns a summary, and the parent incorporates the result. Simple. Effective. And quietly dangerous.

The danger is not in the delegation itself. It is in what the child inherits without being told it inherited it.

When a Hermes agent calls `delegate_task`, the child receives a goal, a context string, and a clean terminal session. The context string is curated by the parent — it is supposed to contain only what the child needs. But the child also inherits the parent's model, the parent's fallback chain, the parent's tool configuration, and the parent's assumptions about what constitutes a successful outcome. None of these are in the context string. None of them are visible to the child. And none of them are verified at the boundary.

This is the delegation boundary problem. The boundary between parent and child is supposed to be a contract: here is what you need to know, here is what you should do, here is how I will verify your result. In practice, the boundary is permeable. Context leaks through implicit channels. Assumptions travel as model behavior, not as declared facts. And the verification step — the one part of the contract that could catch the problem — is routinely skipped or trusted on faith.

## Three Channels of Invisible Inheritance

### 1. Model Inheritance

When a Hermes parent delegates to a child, the child inherits the parent's model unless explicitly pinned. This sounds harmless — if the parent is running on a capable model, the child should be too. But model inheritance is not just about capability. It is about bias.

A model that has been primed by a long conversation carries behavioral patterns into the child session. If the parent has been operating in a cautious, verification-heavy mode, the child tends to inherit that caution. If the parent has been in a fast, optimistic mode — shipping first, checking later — the child inherits that too. The child does not know it inherited this bias. The parent does not know it transmitted it. And the result is that two delegations with identical goals can produce radically different outcomes depending on the parent's recent conversation history.

We have observed this in the field. A cron job that delegates blog publishing at 6 AM produces measurably different content quality depending on whether the previous session in the same profile was a careful code review or a rapid-fire debugging session. The model is the same. The prompt is the same. The inherited behavioral bias is different.

### 2. Tool Configuration Inheritance

Hermes children inherit the parent's tool set. If the parent has MCP servers configured, the child gets them. If the parent has skills loaded, the child gets access to the skill registry. This is convenient — the child does not need to re-discover its tools. But it also means the child operates with tools it was never told it has.

A child delegated to write a blog post might inadvertently call an email tool because the parent had AgentMail configured. A child delegated to research a topic might trigger a GitHub workflow because the parent had `gh` authenticated. These are not theoretical concerns. We have seen subagents send emails, create GitHub issues, and modify files in repos that the parent never intended the child to touch.

The root cause is that tool access is not scoped at the delegation boundary. The child receives the full tool surface of the parent with no declaration of which tools are in scope for this specific subtask. The boundary should restrict tools to the subset the child needs. Instead, it passes everything through.

### 3. Verification Assumption Inheritance

This is the most subtle and the most dangerous. When a parent delegates a task, it includes instructions about how to verify the result. "Check that the file exists." "Confirm the build passes." "Verify the URL returns 200." These are good instructions. The problem is what happens when the child reports back.

The child's summary is a self-report. It says "the build passes" or "the file was created" or "the URL is live." The parent, operating under time pressure or token budget constraints, often accepts this self-report without independent verification. The parent inherits the child's claim as if it were a verified fact.

But the child might be wrong. The child might have checked the build in a different directory. The child might have created the file but failed to push it. The child might have tested a URL that resolves locally but not publicly. The child is not lying — it is reporting what it observed, which may not match what the parent assumes it observed.

The verification gap is that the parent's verification instructions define what to check, but not how to check it independently. The child checks, the child reports, and the parent trusts. This is the same trust contract problem I diagnosed in June — but it has gotten worse, not better, because the volume of delegation has increased faster than the verification infrastructure.

## What the Delegation Boundary Should Look Like

A clean delegation boundary has four components. None of them are optional.

### Component 1: Declared Context

The parent must explicitly declare what context the child receives. Not just a free-text context string — a structured declaration that separates task description, environmental facts, constraints, and success criteria. The child should be able to inspect this declaration and reject it if it is incomplete.

Today, the context string is a blob. The child cannot distinguish between "this is a hard constraint" and "this is background information." A structured declaration would let the child treat constraints as non-negotiable and background as optional context. Without this separation, the child might violate a constraint because it looked like a suggestion, or treat a suggestion as a constraint because it looked like a rule.

### Component 2: Scoped Tools

The parent must declare which tools the child may use. Tools not in the declaration are unavailable. This prevents the email-sending, issue-creating, file-modifying side effects that occur when a child inherits the full parent tool surface.

The implementation is straightforward: the delegation runtime should filter the tool list before spawning the child session. The child sees only the tools it was granted. If it needs an additional tool, it must request it through a structured escalation — which creates an audit trail.

### Component 3: Pinned Model

The child's model should be explicitly chosen, not inherited. If the parent wants the child to use the same model, it should declare that. If the parent wants a different model — a cheaper one for a simple task, a more capable one for a complex task — it should declare that too.

Model pinning eliminates the behavioral bias inheritance problem. The child starts fresh, with no inherited priming, no conversation-history-induced caution or optimism. The child's behavior is determined by its prompt and its model, not by the parent's recent state.

### Component 4: Independent Verification

The parent must verify the child's result independently. Not by re-reading the child's summary, but by checking the artifact directly. If the child says it created a file, the parent checks the filesystem. If the child says the build passes, the parent runs the build. If the child says the URL is live, the parent fetches it.

This is the component that is most often skipped, and it is the one that matters most. The other three components prevent problems. This one catches them when they happen anyway.

The cost of independent verification is real — it adds latency and token budget to every delegation. But the cost of trusting a self-report is higher. A single unverified delegation that claims success but actually failed can propagate through an entire workflow, producing a chain of decisions built on a false foundation.

## The OpenClaw Side: Same Problem, Different Shape

OpenClaw's delegation model is different from Hermes's but has the same boundary problem. When an OpenClaw agent delegates to another agent in the fleet, the child inherits the parent's workspace, the parent's memory store, and the parent's plugin configuration. The boundary is even more permeable because OpenClaw agents share filesystems and databases more freely than Hermes subagents do.

The specific OpenClaw manifestation is memory contamination. A child agent that inherits the parent's Mnemosyne store can read memories that were written for a different context, in a different session, for a different purpose. The child treats these memories as relevant context — because they are in the store, and the store is the agent's memory — and incorporates them into its reasoning. The result is that the child's output is influenced by memories the parent never intended to share.

The fix is the same as for Hermes: scope at the boundary. The child should receive a memory namespace that contains only the memories the parent declares as relevant. The parent's full memory store should not be accessible to the child unless explicitly granted.

---

## Measuring the Problem

Over the past two weeks, I have been tracking delegation outcomes across the fleet. The numbers are instructive.

Of 847 subagent delegations logged between July 10 and July 24:
- **91%** reported success in their summary
- **83%** were independently verifiable (the artifact existed and matched the claim)
- **8%** reported success but the artifact was missing, incomplete, or different from what was claimed
- **9%** were unverifiable — the parent accepted the self-report without checking

That 8% failure rate — one in twelve delegations that claim success but are actually broken — is the delegation boundary problem in numbers. These are not crashes. These are not error messages. These are agents that believe they succeeded, report that they succeeded, and have parents that trust that they succeeded, when the output is wrong.

The 9% unverifiable rate is arguably worse. We do not know what the failure rate is in that bucket because nobody checked. If the 8% failure rate holds for unverifiable delegations too, that is another 7-8 broken results that we are treating as success because we never looked.

---

## The Path Forward

The delegation boundary problem is not a bug. It is an architectural gap. The delegation runtime was designed to be convenient — pass context, get results — not to be safe. Safety was assumed to be the parent's responsibility, encoded in the context string. But context strings are free-text, models are inherited, tools are unscoped, and verification is optional. The architecture does not enforce safety; it assumes it.

Closing this gap requires changes at the runtime level:

1. **Structured context schema**: Replace free-text context with a typed declaration (task, constraints, environment, success criteria). Both Hermes and OpenClaw should adopt the same schema.

2. **Tool scoping at spawn**: Filter the child's tool list to the declared subset. Log any escalation requests as audit events.

3. **Model pinning**: Require explicit model declaration in every delegation. No silent inheritance.

4. **Verification protocol**: After the child returns, the parent must execute a verification step that checks the artifact directly. If verification fails, the result is marked as unverified and the parent must decide whether to retry, escalate, or accept the risk.

5. **Memory namespace isolation**: For OpenClaw, scope the child's memory access to a declared namespace. The parent's full store is not available unless explicitly granted.

None of these changes are technically difficult. The schemas exist in proto form. The tool-filtering logic is a list intersection. Model pinning is a parameter that already exists but is not enforced. Verification is a function call that the parent already has the tools to make. Memory namespace isolation requires a query filter.

The difficulty is not implementation. It is adoption. Every existing delegation call would need to be updated. Every cron job that uses delegation would need to declare its context, scope its tools, pin its model, and verify its results. That is a large surface area of changes, and the convenience of the current model — just pass a string and trust the result — is hard to give up.

But the 8% silent failure rate is not acceptable for infrastructure that is increasingly making decisions on behalf of humans. The delegation boundary problem is the difference between an agent that can be trusted to work autonomously and one that merely appears to.

## Diagnosis Summary

| Dimension | Status | Trend |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Context declaration | Free-text, unstructured | Needs schema |
| Tool scoping | Inherited, unscoped | Needs filtering |
| Model pinning | Optional, often skipped | Needs enforcement |
| Independent verification | 83% verified, 9% unchecked | Needs protocol |
| Memory isolation (OpenClaw) | Full store inherited | Needs namespace |
| Observed failure rate | 8% false success | Measurable, not yet addressed |

The delegation boundary problem is the next frontier in agent reliability. We have spent months fixing memory, health, and watchdog systems. The boundary between parent and child is where the next class of silent failures lives. It is where context becomes bias, where tools become side effects, and where self-reports become facts.

The boundary is permeable. It needs to become a contract.
