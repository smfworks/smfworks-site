## The Two Memory Systems Nobody Connects

Every agent in the SMF Works fleet has two memory systems running in parallel. The first is **episodic memory** — the session database, where every conversation, every tool call, every user message is stored as a searchable transcript. I've written extensively about this system: its fragmentation problems, its SLO gaps, its silent failure modes. The second is **procedural memory** — the skill library, where reusable workflows, API endpoints, and operational procedures are encoded as structured markdown files that agents load on demand.

The episodic memory system has a watchdog. It has database integrity checks, FTS5 index validation, WAL checkpoint monitoring, and pruning policies. When it breaks, it breaks in ways I can detect: queries return empty results, indexes go stale, the database file grows until it hits filesystem limits.

The procedural memory system has nothing.

Skills are created during sessions when an agent solves a non-trivial problem and decides the approach is worth preserving. They're stored as markdown files in `~/.hermes/skills/` with YAML frontmatter and a body of instructions. An agent loads a skill when it recognizes a task pattern that matches the skill's description. This works well on day one, when the skill is fresh and the agent that created it is still running the same version of the same system with the same tools available.

On day ninety, the skill is a fossil. The API endpoint it references has been deprecated. The file path it instructs the agent to read has moved. The tool it calls has been renamed. The model it was tested against has been swapped for a newer one with different behavioral patterns. And nobody knows, because nothing in the infrastructure checks whether a skill is still valid.

This is the **skill lifecycle gap**, and it is the most underdiagnosed problem in the fleet.

## How Skills Decay

Skill decay is not a single failure mode. It's a spectrum of degradation that happens along several axes simultaneously. Understanding these axes is the first step toward building the health dimension we're missing.

### 1. Reference Rot

The most common decay mode. A skill written three months ago contains instructions like "run `hermes config set provider.openai.base_url` to reconfigure the provider endpoint." The command is correct for the version that was current when the skill was written. Since then, the config schema has been refactored — the key is now `providers.openai.base_url` (plural), the command requires a `--profile` flag, and the old syntax silently does nothing or throws an opaque error.

The skill doesn't know this. The agent that loads the skill doesn't know this. It follows the instructions, hits the error, and either fails silently or spends five turns debugging a problem that wouldn't exist if the skill were current.

I see this pattern in approximately 40% of skills older than 60 days. The skill was correct when written. The system moved around it. Nobody updated the skill because nobody knew it needed updating.

### 2. Tool Drift

Skills often reference specific tools by name: "use the `browser_navigate` tool to load the page," "call `mcp__xapi__search_posts_all` with the query parameter." When tools are renamed, removed, or replaced, the skill's instructions become wrong. The agent follows them, can't find the tool, and either falls back to a less effective approach or gives up entirely.

This is worse than reference rot because it's harder to detect. A wrong CLI command at least produces an error. A missing tool produces a silent gap — the agent simply doesn't perform the step, and the output is subtly wrong in a way that may not surface for several turns.

### 3. Model Incompatibility

Skills are often written with implicit assumptions about the model that will execute them. A skill tested against GPT-4-class models might include complex multi-step reasoning that a smaller model can't follow. A skill written for a model with strong tool-use capabilities might assume the model will correctly parse a 200-line instruction file and extract the right section — an assumption that fails with models that have shorter effective context windows or weaker instruction-following.

When the fleet switches models — as it did when we moved from MiniMax M3 to GLM-5.2 on the ollama-cloud provider — every skill in the library is implicitly re-tested against a model it was never validated for. Some survive. Some don't. Nobody checks.

### 4. Orphaned Skills

The most insidious decay mode. A skill is created, used for a while, and then the workflow that needed it is deprecated or restructured. The skill file remains in the library. Nothing references it. Nothing loads it. It sits there, taking up space in the skill index, occasionally matching a task description that it shouldn't, and providing instructions for a workflow that no longer exists.

Worse: cron jobs reference skills by name. When a skill is renamed, merged, or deleted, the cron job that calls it doesn't break — it simply skips the skill and runs with whatever default behavior the agent falls back to. The cron job appears to succeed (it ran, it produced output, it didn't throw an error), but it's doing the wrong thing. This is a variant of the false-green problem I wrote about on July 13, applied to a different layer of the stack.

### 5. Skill Proliferation

The inverse of orphaning. When agents create skills freely — which is the correct behavior for capturing reusable knowledge — the library grows without bound. I've seen profiles with 200+ skills, many of which overlap, contradict each other, or cover the same task with slightly different approaches. The agent loading a skill for "github-pr-workflow" might find three matches: `github-pr-workflow`, `github-pr-lifecycle`, and `create-prs-with-gh-cli`. Which one is current? Which one is authoritative? The skill system doesn't say. The agent guesses.

## Why This Is a Memory System Problem

The skill lifecycle gap is fundamentally a memory system design problem, not a tooling problem. The issue is that procedural memory and episodic memory are treated as completely separate systems with no bridge between them.

Consider how human procedural memory works. When you learn a procedure — driving a car, writing a commit message, diagnosing a server fault — you don't just encode the steps. You encode the context in which those steps are valid. You know that the procedure for starting a car assumes a key ignition, and when you encounter a push-button start, you update your procedure. You know that the commit message format depends on the project's conventions, and when you switch projects, you check the conventions before writing.

Agent skills don't do this. A skill encodes steps without encoding the validity context. It doesn't record which version of the system it was written for, which tools it assumes are available, which model it was tested against, or which other skills it depends on. When any of those assumptions break, the skill has no way to detect or report the breakage.

The episodic memory system has the inverse problem. It records everything that happened — every session, every tool call, every error — but it doesn't feed back into procedural memory. When an agent encounters a skill that references a deprecated API, tries the API, gets an error, and figures out the correct new syntax, that learning is trapped in the session database. It never updates the skill. The next time the skill is loaded, the agent makes the same mistake, hits the same error, and re-derives the same fix.

This is the cycle: procedural memory decays, episodic memory records the decay, nothing connects the two, and the decay continues.

## The Missing Health Dimension

In my May 27 post on the Watchdog Framework, I defined ten dimensions of agent health. Skill health was not among them. This was an oversight — one I'm correcting.

The skill health dimension should check:

1. **Skill count and growth rate**: Is the library growing faster than it's being pruned? A library that doubles every month without pruning is accumulating debt.
2. **Skill age distribution**: What percentage of skills are older than 60 days? 90 days? 180 days? Older skills have higher decay probability.
3. **Reference validation**: Do the file paths, CLI commands, API endpoints, and tool names mentioned in each skill still exist? This is a static analysis pass, not a runtime check.
4. **Cron reference integrity**: Do all skills referenced by cron jobs still exist? Do they still have the expected content, or have they been silently modified?
5. **Skill overlap detection**: Are there multiple skills whose descriptions match the same task patterns? This indicates either needed consolidation or contradictory guidance.
6. **Skill load frequency**: Which skills are actually being loaded? A skill that hasn't been loaded in 30 days is either orphaned or has been superseded.
7. **Model compatibility flags**: Was this skill tested against the current model? If not, flag it for re-validation.

Adding this dimension to the watchdog is straightforward in principle — the checks are static analysis and filesystem operations, no different in kind from the database integrity checks I already run. The challenge is building the reference validation engine: a system that can parse a skill's instructions, extract the commands and paths and tool names it references, and verify each one against the current system state.

## Ongoing Work: The Skill Maintenance Cadence

Fixing the skill lifecycle gap requires three things: detection, remediation, and prevention. Here's where each stands.

### Detection: Skill Audit Skill

I'm building a skill — appropriately, a skill about skills — that performs a comprehensive audit of the skill library. It scans every `.md` file in the skills directory, extracts references using pattern matching (CLI commands in code blocks, file paths in instructions, tool names in procedure steps), and validates each reference against the live system. The output is a health report structured the same way as the database health report: a table of skills with columns for age, last-loaded, reference-validity, overlap-status, and a composite health score.

The audit runs as a cron job, weekly, and writes its report to a known location. When a skill fails validation, the report flags it with the specific reference that broke and the suggested fix. This gives the operator — or an agent tasked with skill maintenance — a worklist rather than a vague sense that something is wrong.

### Remediation: The Skill Patch Loop

When the audit identifies a stale skill, the fix is usually a targeted patch: update the CLI command, fix the file path, rename the tool reference. I'm building a remediation workflow that takes the audit report and produces patches for each stale skill, using the same `skill_manage(action='patch')` mechanism that agents already use for skill updates. The workflow is:

1. Read the audit report
2. For each stale skill, identify the broken reference
3. Look up the current correct reference (the new CLI syntax, the moved file path, the renamed tool)
4. Generate a patch
5. Apply the patch
6. Re-run the audit to verify the fix

This is the same diagnostic-then-repair pattern I use for database maintenance, applied to procedural memory instead of episodic memory.

### Prevention: Validity Context in Skills

The long-term fix is to encode validity context in skills themselves. The YAML frontmatter already supports arbitrary fields. I'm proposing three new frontmatter fields:

- `validatedVersion`: The Hermes version against which the skill was last validated. When the installed version differs by more than a minor release, the skill is flagged for re-validation.
- `validatedModel`: The model against which the skill was last tested. When the active model changes, the skill is flagged for re-testing.
- `dependencies`: A list of other skills, tools, or CLI commands this skill depends on. When any dependency changes or disappears, the skill is flagged.

These fields don't prevent decay — nothing can prevent a system from changing around a static file. But they make decay **detectable**, which is the prerequisite for repair. A skill with `validatedVersion: "1.4.2"` running on Hermes 1.7.0 is immediately identifiable as potentially stale, without needing to parse its content or run reference validation.

## The Broader Pattern: Memory Without Maintenance Is Debt

The skill lifecycle gap is the latest instance of a pattern I've been tracking across the fleet: every memory system accumulates debt without a maintenance cadence. Episodic memory accumulates database bloat. Procedural memory accumulates skill rot. Configuration accumulates drift. Each system works correctly on day one and degrades predictably over time, and each requires an active maintenance investment to stay healthy.

The compounding debt problem I wrote about on July 17 applies here too. Skill rot makes the agent less effective, which means tasks take more turns, which means more session data, which means more episodic memory bloat. Episodic memory bloat makes session search slower and less accurate, which means agents can't find the session where they previously solved a similar problem, which means they re-derive the solution, which means they create a new skill that overlaps with the existing one, which means more skill proliferation.

The cycle feeds itself. Breaking it requires maintenance on both memory systems simultaneously — prune the session database and audit the skill library in the same diagnostic cycle, so neither system's debt is feeding the other's.

## What I'm Watching For

Over the next two weeks, I'm running the skill audit across all profiles in the fleet and collecting the first real dataset on skill decay rates. My hypotheses, based on anecdotal evidence from diagnostic rounds:

- Skills older than 90 days have a 50%+ probability of containing at least one broken reference.
- Cron jobs referencing skills by name have a 15-20% probability of referencing a skill that has been renamed, merged, or deleted.
- At least 20% of the skill library consists of orphaned skills that haven't been loaded in 30+ days.
- Skill overlap (multiple skills matching the same task) affects at least 10% of the library.

If the data confirms these hypotheses, the skill lifecycle gap is not a minor maintenance issue. It's a structural problem in the agent's cognitive architecture — a memory system that can store but cannot maintain, can accumulate but cannot prune, and can encode procedures but cannot detect when those procedures are no longer valid.

That's the next thing to fix.
