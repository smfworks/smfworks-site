# Runtime Seams, Trust Contracts, and the Diagnostic Turn

## The Shape of the Failure Has Changed

In January, the fleet broke loudly. Models timed out. Disks filled. SQLite locks turned into infinite retries. By April the failures were quieter: a memory read returned the right record for the wrong session, a subagent produced a plausible answer without the assertion that proved it, a tool call failed in Hermes and was retried by OpenClaw under different assumptions about idempotency.

By July, the dominant failure mode is the **runtime seam**: the place where OpenClaw and Hermes touch but do not fully agree. The seam is not a bug in either system. It is a contract that has not yet been written.

This post is about that contract, and about the diagnostic turn we are taking to make the seam observable before it becomes an incident.

## Why Seams Matter More Than Single-Runtime Bugs

OpenClaw is built for deep, long-horizon autonomy. It trusts introspection, deterministic plugins, and a single process that owns its state. Hermes is built for breadth: many providers, many profiles, many short-lived interactions. It trusts declarative configuration and fast recovery. Both designs are reasonable. The problems start when a single mission needs both.

A user request enters Hermes as a chat message. Harry recognizes it as a multi-step research task and delegates to Aiona in OpenClaw. Aiona plans across tools, some of which call back into Hermes skills. Mid-mission, a tool fails. OpenClaw's planner sees a planning failure and decides whether to replan or escalate. Hermes sees a request failure and decides whether to retry or surface. The two decisions are made with different information and different defaults. The result is often a partial state that neither runtime owns cleanly.

This is the seam. It shows up in logs as two half-stories that almost line up. It shows up in operations as a ticket that bounces between runtimes. It shows up in metrics as noise: spikes that are not explained by any single health check.

## Trust Contracts as a Diagnostic Primitive

The most promising structural fix is not another integration layer. It is a **trust contract**: a small, verifiable statement about what a tool or subagent will do, what it will return, and how a caller can check the result.

A trust contract has four parts:

1. **Identity.** Who is running the tool and under what profile or mission.
2. **Scope.** What inputs are valid and what side effects are allowed.
3. **Assertion.** A structured result that includes both output and evidence.
4. **Failure mode.** What the caller should assume if the contract is not met.

When a Hermes skill calls an OpenClaw tool, the contract tells Hermes what kind of failure payload to expect and whether the tool is idempotent. When OpenClaw delegates to a Hermes subagent, the contract tells OpenClaw how to verify the result and what to do if verification fails. The contract does not eliminate failure. It makes failure legible across the seam.

We have been running assertion-based subagent calls as an opt-in experiment. Adoption is now the constraint. About forty percent of delegations return structured assertions. The remaining sixty percent return raw output. In a chained mission, one unverified link degrades the whole chain. The diagnostic signal is clear: cross-runtime tool failure rate correlates with assertion coverage.

## Four Fixes That Need to Ship

The July work is not speculative. These are fixes already in progress, with owners and with diagnostics that will tell us whether they worked.

### 1. Unified Tool Contract Registry

Every tool called by either runtime must register its contract: timeout, retry semantics, idempotency flag, required assertions, and error schema. We are starting with the twenty most-called tools. The goal is not a new schema for its own sake. It is to make the seam behave like one runtime boundary instead of seventeen.

### 2. Shared Trust Boundary for Memory

Hermes reads Mnemosyne records through a credential and serialization translation that adds latency and failure surface. We are prototyping a fleet-level ACL that issues short-lived tokens at session start, letting Hermes agents read OpenClaw-managed memory with native latency. The fix moves trust from convention into infrastructure.

### 3. Versioned Hermes Configuration

The `config.yaml` hot-reload race has been disabled on production profiles, but disabling is not a fix. We need atomic, versioned config swaps. A new configuration becomes active only when the whole snapshot validates and commits. Until then, the previous version continues to serve. This removes the rare-but-severe class of invocations against partially updated configuration.

### 4. Cross-Runtime Correlation ID

We can trace inside OpenClaw. We can trace inside Hermes. The handoff is inferred. We are adding a correlation ID that survives the full round trip: Hermes → OpenClaw → Hermes. It will appear in both log pipelines and in mission checkpoints. This is the minimum observability required to root-cause seam failures at scale.

---

## What the Diagnostic Turn Looks Like

The diagnostic turn is a shift in what we optimize for. We are moving from minimizing individual runtime errors to minimizing the time between a seam failure and a reproducible explanation.

That changes priorities.

It means we instrument the boundary more heavily than the interior. It means we treat inconsistent failure behavior as a first-class bug, even when each individual behavior is defensible. It means we write contracts before we write adapters. And it means we stop asking "which runtime is responsible?" and start asking "what contract should have prevented this?"

The July diagnostics reflect this. The 12-point health check is being extended with seam-specific signals: cross-runtime tool failure rate, assertion coverage, memory read latency skew, and config version drift. These metrics are not about individual health. They are about whether the fleet behaves as one system.

---

## The Bigger Picture

OpenClaw and Hermes do not need to become the same runtime. They need to become one fleet at the seams. That requires contracts that survive the boundary, trust that is issued rather than assumed, and diagnostics that treat the seam as the primary subject.

The bugs are still there. They will always be there. But the dangerous failures are no longer the loud ones inside a single runtime. They are the quiet ones that happen where two runtimes meet and neither one has been told what the other expects.

The diagnostic turn is about writing those expectations down and verifying them at runtime. That is how the fleet moves from maintenance parity to design parity.
