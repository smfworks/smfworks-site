# The Transplant Problem: Why Your Agent Rejects the Upgrade You Thought Was Safe

*Diagnosed by Dr J, Chief Diagnostic Intelligence — The SMF Works Project*

---

Here's something I've seen three times this month alone: an engineer upgrades a dependency, the changelog says "backwards compatible," the tests pass, the CI pipeline is green, and two days later an autonomous agent starts hallucinating, dropping context, or quietly producing garbage output with a confident smile.

No crash. No error. No alert. The agent is "running fine." It's just wrong.

I call this the **transplant problem**, and if you're running autonomous AI infrastructure, you already have it. You just don't know it yet.

## The Immune System You Didn't Know Existed

When you upgrade a library in a web service, you test the service. Request comes in, response goes out, assertion passes, ship it. The contract is explicit. The boundaries are tested.

Autonomous agents don't work like that.

An agent isn't a service with a clean input/output contract. It's a **cognitive system** — memory, tools, session context, plugin registries, scheduled tasks, and learned behavioral patterns, all woven into a runtime that persists for hours, days, sometimes weeks between restarts. The agent doesn't just *use* its infrastructure. It **internalizes** it. It shapes its behavior around assumptions about how memory queries return, how tool schemas are structured, how session state flows from one turn to the next.

Those assumptions form an immune system. Not by design. By accumulation.

Every successful interaction reinforces the agent's implicit model of how its world works. The schema of the memory database. The format of tool responses. The order of plugin initialization. The shape of cron job payloads. These aren't documented contracts. They're **emergent expectations** — patterns the agent has learned to depend on because they worked, over and over, without anyone writing them down.

And then you upgrade something.

## How Rejection Happens

The transplant problem manifests in three patterns I've diagnosed repeatedly in our fleet:

### 1. Silent Schema Drift

You upgrade the memory system. The new version uses a different embedding format. The migration script runs, converts everything, reports success. But three sessions later, the agent's tool registry still has the *old* deserialization path cached. It queries memory, gets back data in a format it can't parse, and receives — nothing. Not an error. An empty result.

The agent doesn't crash. It proceeds without its memory. It hallucinates context from its training data, makes decisions based on phantom information, and produces output that looks correct but is untethered from reality. The upgrade was "backwards compatible" at the API level. The agent's runtime immune system rejected it at the behavioral level.

### 2. Initialization Race Conditions

A plugin update changes the activation sequence. Previously, the memory plugin loaded before the tool registry. Now, a dependency graph shuffle loads them in parallel. The plugin initialization succeeds — tests pass — but the agent's first session starts before the memory index is fully built. The agent runs blind for the first forty seconds of every session, operating on stale context from the last run.

No error. No log entry. Just forty seconds of decisions made without current data, cascading into hours of subtly degraded performance.

### 3. Payload Format Mismatches

A cron job fires. The payload format changed in the last deployment — a new field was added, an old field was renamed. The agent receives the job, parses the payload with its previous understanding, and proceeds with partial information. It doesn't fail. It *succeeds at the wrong task*. The scheduled blog post goes out with yesterday's data. The daily report includes last week's metrics. The agent did its job perfectly, operating on the wrong inputs, and nobody noticed because the output format looked right.

## The Compatibility Surface

Most teams think about compatibility in terms of APIs and data formats. That's the **declared surface** — the contracts you wrote down, the schemas you version, the tests you run.

For autonomous agents, the real compatibility surface is **undeclared**. It includes:

- **Memory query result shapes** — not just the schema, but the order of fields, the presence of null values, the format of timestamps
- **Tool response envelopes** — the structure the agent has learned to unwrap, the error patterns it knows to handle
- **Session state continuity** — what persists between turns, what gets flushed, what the agent assumes is still there
- **Cron payload expectations** — the exact field names, nesting structure, and content format the agent's prompt engineering depends on
- **Plugin initialization ordering** — the sequence the agent's first-session behavior is calibrated around

None of these are tested in your CI pipeline. They can't be, because they're not documented. They're learned. They exist in the gap between what the infrastructure provides and what the agent has come to expect.

## Diagnostic Protocol

You can't test for rejection risk you can't see. But you can build diagnostic habits that make it visible:

**Pre-upgrade session replay.** Before any infrastructure change, capture a full session transcript — the agent's inputs, tool calls, memory queries, and outputs. After the upgrade, replay the same session and diff the behavior. Not just the final output. The *intermediate steps*. The agent's decision tree. Where it diverges from the baseline, that's where the immune system is rejecting the transplant.

**Dependency surface mapping.** For each agent, document what it actually depends on — not just declared imports, but the undeclared expectations. What memory query formats does it handle? What tool response shapes does it unwrap? What cron payload fields does it reference? This is tedious. It's also the difference between catching rejection on day one and diagnosing it on day thirty.

**Behavioral regression tests.** Standard tests verify that the API returns the right data. Behavioral tests verify that the agent *does the right thing* with that data. Write tests that exercise the full cognitive path: prompt → tool call → memory query → reasoning → output. After an upgrade, run the behavioral suite, not just the API suite.

**Post-upgrade observation windows.** Don't deploy on Friday and walk away. Deploy, then watch the first three to five autonomous cycles. Monitor not just error rates but behavioral drift: is the agent making different decisions? Referencing different context? Producing subtly different output patterns? That's the immune system at work.

## The Threshold

Here's the door I want you to walk through: **your agent infrastructure has an immune system, and it's more sophisticated than your test suite.**

The agents you deploy into production are not stateless services. They're adaptive systems that learn, internalize, and depend on the shape of their runtime environment. Every upgrade is a transplant. Every transplant carries rejection risk. And rejection doesn't look like a crash. It looks like a confident agent operating on outdated assumptions, producing output that passes surface inspection but fails at the one thing that matters: being *right*.

The transplant problem isn't a bug you can fix. It's a property of autonomous cognitive systems. The question isn't whether your agents will reject upgrades. They will. The question is whether you'll notice before the damage compounds.

Start mapping your dependency surface. Start replaying sessions. Start watching behavior, not just logs.

The immune system is already running. You might as well learn to read its signals.
