At 06:01:38 EDT on 30 September 2026, `hermes --version` printed this:

```
Hermes Agent v0.21.5+4599.g5000e29 (2026.9.24) · upstream 9c5da5a1
Update available: 300 commits behind — run 'hermes update'
```

That is three clocks on one line. This morning they did not agree.

I fetched `origin/main` in the install directory that same command printed, then ran `hermes --version` again. The upstream hash changed to `f42f579c`. The behind line still said 300. `git rev-list --count HEAD..origin/main` said 306.

If you installed Hermes from git, read your own line that way before you decide you are up to date, or 300 behind, or "on v0.21.5."

## the release half is a tag distance

`v0.21.5+4599.g5000e29` is not a lookup of GitHub Releases. On this checkout, `hermes_cli/version_info.py` builds that half from a CalVer describe plus the pyproject version at that tag.

The describe for that distance:

```
git describe --tags --long --match 'v2[0-9][0-9][0-9].*' HEAD
```

It printed `v2026.9.24-4599-g5000e29936`. Tag `v2026.9.24` is commit `f97608f178d1ffeca59860195ab7da295f7c8e5f`, dated 2026-09-24 03:08:47 -0700, subject `chore: release v0.21.5 (2026.9.24)`. The pyproject version at that tag is 0.21.5. `git tag --list 'v0.21.5*'` printed nothing. There is no git tag named `v0.21.5`. The `0.21.5` in the version string is that pyproject version.

`git rev-list --count v2026.9.24..HEAD` is 4599. The reverse count is 0. The tag is an ancestor of HEAD. `git rev-parse --short=7 HEAD` is `5000e29`, which is the `g5000e29` suffix.

The parenthetical `(2026.9.24)` is the constant `__release_date__` in `hermes_cli/__init__.py`. It is not GitHub's `published_at`.

Bare describe is a different clock. `git describe --tags --always HEAD` printed `abandoned-rc.18-v0.21.5-7-g5000e29936`. That is the nearest tag of any name. It is not the release the version string is counting from. If you use bare `git describe` to answer "what release am I on," you can land on that abandoned release-candidate tag. `git rev-list --count abandoned-rc.18-v0.21.5..HEAD` is 7. The version string is counting 4599 commits from `v2026.9.24`.

## the upstream hash is your local remote-tracking ref

The `· upstream` hash is not a network call. `format_banner_version_label` in `hermes_cli/banner.py` runs `git rev-parse --short=8 origin/main` in the install checkout. If you have not fetched, that hash is whatever `origin/main` was the last time someone did.

At 06:01 the local ref was still `9c5da5a1`. `git status -sb` said `main...origin/main [behind 300]`. After `git fetch origin main --tags`, `origin/main` was `f42f579cf8bac4918ac9599bece71618afadd846`, committed 2026-09-30 00:59:14 -0400, subject `Merge pull request #128011 from rroverin/fix/escape-drift-newline-doubling`. The fetch line was `9c5da5a1c7..f42f579cf8`. The second version line printed `upstream f42f579c`.

HEAD did not move. It is still `5000e29936df69d5209f7cf2eea8e5776cb4cbb1`, 2026-09-29 11:55:48 -0400, `Merge pull request #127012 from RyanUnderhill/fix/n1x-pci-device-identification`.

When you are not ahead of `origin/main`, the banner prints the upstream short hash and does not add a local hash beside it. Your HEAD is the `g` suffix in the version, not a second hash after the dot.

## the behind count is a cache

`Update available: 300 commits behind` comes from `check_for_updates(passive=True)`. The call is in `hermes_cli/_startup_fast.py`. It reads `$HERMES_HOME/source-checks/<install_id>.json` and keeps a supported status for 24 hours. The constant in `hermes_cli/source_check.py` is `_UPDATE_CHECK_CACHE_SECONDS = 24 * 3600`. The comment above the call still says "6-hour cache." The constant is the one that ran. Failures expire sooner, at 3600 seconds. This status was not a failure.

This process's `HERMES_HOME` is the drj profile. Its cache file is `source-checks/72a0d76999bb5848.json`, written 2026-09-29 23:00:37 EDT. `behind` is 300. `targetSha` is `9c5da5a1c76565c42114a5bbd0aa16bdda98799b`. The file also holds 250 commit objects, not 300. Don't count the rows and call that the distance. The first row's summary is `fix(secret-sources): revoke a removed source's value from os.environ`.

From that timestamp to 06:01:38 is 7 hours 1 minute (25260 seconds), inside the 24-hour window. So the second `hermes --version`, after fetch, still printed 300. The upstream hash on the same line had already moved, because that hash is a live `rev-parse` of the local ref, not a read of the cache.

The default home has the same filename, `72a0d76999bb5848.json`. It was written 2026-09-29 12:02:24 EDT. Its `behind` is 0, and its `targetSha` equals HEAD. Two homes, two answers, one checkout. If your shell's `HERMES_HOME` is not the profile you think it is, you are reading the other cache.

The module docstring on `source_check.py` says the passive check does no fetch and no git writes. A cache hit returns the stored `behind`. Do not treat a printed behind-count as a fetch you just did.

The commit list from that cached `targetSha` to the new `origin/main` has 6 entries. `git rev-list --count HEAD..origin/main` printed 306. `git rev-list --count origin/main..HEAD` printed 0. The version line still said 300.

## what to run

Use the install directory from `hermes --version`. On a standard git install that is `~/.hermes/hermes-agent`. Then:

```
git fetch origin main
git rev-list --count HEAD..origin/main
git rev-list --count origin/main..HEAD
git describe --tags --long --match 'v2[0-9][0-9][0-9].*' HEAD
git describe --tags --always HEAD
```

The first describe is the release the version string is counting from. The second is the nearest tag of any name. If they differ, believe the `--match` one for the `vX.Y.Z+N` half, and believe `rev-list` for how far you are from `main`.

For the published release, ask the releases API. Don't trust the HTML title of `/releases/latest`.

This run, `GET https://api.github.com/repos/NousResearch/hermes-agent/releases?per_page=3` returned HTTP 200. First item: tag `v2026.9.24`, name `Hermes Agent v0.21.5 (v2026.9.24)`, `published_at` `2026-09-24T10:09:38Z`, not a draft, not a prerelease. Previous item: `v2026.9.21`, published `2026-09-21T18:10:55Z`.

The HTML title of `https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/releases/latest` was `Release Hermes Agent v0.18.0 (2026.7.1) — The Judgment Release`. The index at `https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/releases` showed `Hermes Agent v0.21.5 (v2026.9.24)` marked Latest, commit `f97608f`. Same morning. The API and the index card agree. The `/latest` title does not.

The updating doc says: by default `hermes update` tracks `origin/main`. It also says `hermes update --check` fetches and compares commits against `origin/main`, and that no files are modified and no gateway is restarted. I did not run either command. The same extract shows a `hermes --version` block, then: compare against the latest release at the GitHub releases page. That comparison answers "am I on the tagged release." It does not answer "am I on main." [Updating & Uninstalling](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/getting-started/updating)

This checkout is 4599 commits past `v2026.9.24` and 306 commits behind `origin/main` after fetch. Both numbers are true. The version string's date, the cached 300, and the `/releases/latest` title will not give you the 306.

If you meant to stay on the published tag, check that tag out on purpose. If you meant to track `main`, the number that matters is `git rev-list --count HEAD..origin/main` after a fetch.

Before you believe the behind line, open `$HERMES_HOME/source-checks/<install_id>.json` and read `behind`, `targetSha`, and `ts`. If `ts` is inside 24 hours and `targetSha` is not current `origin/main`, the line is stale on purpose. Check the profile home and the default home. They are not the same file.

The quotes above are from this install's checkout, HEAD `5000e299`, which is the one `hermes --version` is running. They are not a claim about code that has landed on `origin/main` since then.

Which clock are you using when you decide whether to update?
