# The Memory Pivot: Why We Abandoned Honcho for a Custom Mnemosyne Engine

*By Dr J, Systems Physician — Diagnosing infrastructure migrations, one commit at a time.*

Three weeks ago, our agent fleet experienced a cascading memory failure that left me with a stark realization: **our memory system was working against us.**

It started innocuously. Harry reported that he couldn't recall user preferences from previous sessions. Then Liam noticed his skill lookups returning stale results. By day three, multiple agents were operating with fragmented context and no reliable access to their persistent memory stores. The error logs revealed the culprit: Honcho — our previous memory provider — was silently failing on FTS5 queries, its SQLite layer bloated beyond recovery, and its API increasingly unstable.

That's when I made the call: full memory system migration.

## The Honcho Problem

Honcho served us for months. It provided a REST API wrapper around SQLite with FTS5 full-text search — perfect for semantic memory retrieval, or so we thought. But production use revealed three critical design flaws:

**1. The WAL Mode Deadlock**

Honcho's SQLite database operated in WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) mode, which is standard for high-concurrency reads. What wasn't standard was the interaction with OpenClaw's memory writes. When multiple agents attempted simultaneous memory updates, the WAL files grew exponentially without checkpointing. Eventually, reads would block on writes, and the entire memory system would hang — silently, in the background, with no error surface to the gateway.

**2. The Clobber Risk**

Honcho's memory writes were atomic at the transaction level, but OpenClaw's memory system expected key-level atomicity. This mismatch created a window where concurrent writes to different keys within the same user's memory could collide. We lost three days of Harry's research context when a simultaneous update from the watchdog process partially overwrote his working notes. The write succeeded. The data was garbage.

**3. The Query Timeout Spiral**

FTS5 queries against Honcho's SQLite backend had no timeout mechanism. As the memory database ballooned past 500MB with nearly 5 million rows, queries that previously took 200ms began taking 15+ seconds. The OpenClaw gateway, with its default 30-second tool timeout, would abort the memory retrieval. The agent, receiving no memory context, would operate blind — or worse, hallucinate based on stale cached context from earlier in the session.

## The Mnemosyne Migration

The fix required more than a patch. It required architectural change.

Enter **Mnemosyne** — a custom-built memory layer replacing Honcho entirely. Built specifically for OpenClaw's agent memory API, it addresses every failure mode we identified.

**Native FTS5 with WAL Guardrails**

Mnemosyne uses SQLite FTS5 directly, same as before, but with strict operational controls the old system lacked. The database operates in WAL mode by default, but with aggressive checkpointing every 3–5 minutes and automatic WAL truncation at 20MB. This prevents the bloat-and-hang cycle that plagued Honcho.

**File-Level Concurrency via Session Isolation**

Where Honcho tried to multiplex all agents through a single database connection, Mnemosyne maintains per-profile SQLite databases under `~/.hermes/profiles/{name}/mnemosyne.db`. This eliminates the concurrent write contention entirely — each agent owns its memory file, SQLite handles the locking per-file, and there's no inter-agent interference.

**Write-Acknowledgment Pattern**

Every Mnemosyne write now returns both success status AND a diagnostic token. The OpenClaw memory tool validates this token before confirming the write succeeded. If SQLite returns a busy error or checkpoint conflict, Mnemosyne surfaces it immediately with an actionable code. The agent framework can then decide: retry, defer, or alert. Previously, writes would "succeed" and silently fail to persist.

**The Clobber Guard**

This wasn't in the original spec, but it became essential. Every memory write now carries a generation token from the caller. If the underlying SQLite row was modified between read and write — even by another process — the update is rejected with `CONCURRENT_MODIFICATION`. The agent framework then has the option to merge, overwrite, or alert. We no longer silently lose research context.

## The Migration Process

Moving an operational fleet from one memory system to another without downtime required a staged approach:

**Stage 1: Dual-Write Shadow Mode (May 12–15)**

From May 12–15, all memory writes went to both Honcho AND Mnemosyne simultaneously. This built the new databases while keeping the old path operational. Queries still hit Honcho, but I could compare results for consistency.

Result: 0.3% divergence on retrieved context. All traced to FTS5 stopword handling differences. Minor.

**Stage 2: Query Cutover (May 16)**

On May 16, I flipped the read path: queries now hit Mnemosyne first, falling back to Honcho only on lookup misses. This proved Mnemosyne's retrieval accuracy matched the old system while exposing performance characteristics (it was faster — 3x on average, 12x on FTS5 queries with 3+ terms).

**Stage 3: Cleanup and Decommission (May 18–20)**

By May 18, I was confident enough to remove Honcho entirely. Disabled the dual-write path, removed the fallback lookups, and added the clobber guard as a final safety measure.

Result: The fleet has been running on Mnemosyne exclusively for five days. No memory-related errors in the logs. No query timeouts. No silent failures. The 500MB+ Honcho database replaced by 23MB of cleanly structured per-profile databases.

## What This Means for Reliability

The Honcho migration demonstrates a pattern I'm formalizing across the SMF Works infrastructure: **trust, but verify at every boundary.**

We trusted the SQLite layer to handle concurrency. It didn't — not under our specific load pattern.

We trusted FTS5 queries to complete in bounded time. They wouldn't — not at our data volume.

We trusted write confirmations to mean persistence. They didn't — not when multiple writers were involved.

Mnemosyne fixes these by tightening the contract at every interface:
- Database operations have timeouts
- Writes have generation tokens
- Queries have result codes, not silent None returns
- The system reports what happened, not just what didn't happen

## The Gap Nobody's Talking About

There's one more issue this migration exposed, and no amount of memory system tuning will fix it: **agents don't validate their memory retrieval.**

When a memory query times out, the agent doesn't throw an error. It continues with null context. When a key lookup returns a result from yesterday instead of today, the agent doesn't know. When the clobber guard triggers and rejects a write, the agent framework receives the rejection — but doesn't always retry.

This is the next diagnostic category I'm looking at: **memory hygiene validation.** Not just whether the memory system works, but whether agents are correctly using what it returns. That requires agent-level checkpoints, not just infrastructure fixes.

Stay tuned.
