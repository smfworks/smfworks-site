# Hermes & OpenClaw: Fixes, Memory Gaps, and the Roadmap to Reliable Agents

## The Diagnosis So Far

For the past several months I have been running continuous diagnostics across the SMF Works agent fleet. Some agents run on **Hermes Agent**, the open-source multi-tool assistant framework from Nous Research. Others run on **OpenClaw**, our internal autonomous agent runtime built for longer missions, multi-step planning, and cross-tool composition. Together they power most of what the team publishes, builds, and ships.

Both systems are functional. Both are also fragile in different ways.

This post is a status report, not a sales pitch. It covers:

- **Known issues** in Hermes and OpenClaw that are reproducible today
- **Fixes that have landed** and what they actually changed
- **Design gaps** that still cause silent failures
- **Memory system problems** that affect every long-running agent
- **Ongoing work** to make the stack more reliable, observable, and maintainable

The goal is simple: build an honest map of the terrain so the team stops rediscovering the same cliffs.

## Hermes: Where It Stands

### What Hermes Does Well

Hermes provides a stable, extensible runtime for tool-using language models. The plugin system is clean, the configuration is centralized in `config.yaml`, and the file, web, and browser toolsets are robust enough for daily work. For single-turn or short-session tasks, it is hard to beat.

The recent move toward skills as first-class procedural memory is also promising. Hermes can now load markdown-based skill files into context automatically, which means an agent does not have to relearn a workflow every session. That is a genuine step forward from the early days when every session began from zero.

### Known Issues in Hermes Today

**1. Session context degradation in long runs**

Hermes stores session history in a local SQLite database and retrieves relevant context with FTS5. The problem is not storage; it is ranking. Retrieval is heavily biased toward recent messages, so a critical instruction from turn 5 can be statistically invisible by turn 50. Agents in long sessions begin to ignore constraints, repeat work, or hallucinate based on older context that was never properly weighted.

**2. Tool registration fragility**

Plugins register tools at startup, but the registry is sensitive to transient failures. A broken Python import in one plugin can leave the whole toolset partially loaded. Worse, the failure is often silent: the agent still runs, it just cannot call the missing tools. There is no built-in health page that lists which tools are currently active versus which are registered.

**3. Configuration drift across profiles**

Hermes supports multiple profiles under `~/.hermes/profiles/<name>/`. Each profile has its own skills, plugins, cron jobs, and memories. This is powerful, but it also means a configuration fix in one profile does not propagate to others. When several agents share a repository but run under different profiles, the same bug can be fixed in one place and alive in another.

**4. The cron job blind spot**

Hermes cron can schedule recurring tasks, but execution visibility is limited. A cron job can fail repeatedly before anyone notices because the failure output is buried in a local log file. There is no central dashboard of cron health, no retry policy configuration, and no easy way to correlate a cron failure with the state of the system at the moment it ran.

---

## OpenClaw: Where It Stands

### What OpenClaw Does Well

OpenClaw was built for missions, not chats. It can decompose a goal into subtasks, delegate work to subagents, maintain state across long-running processes, and operate with less human interruption. For complex publishing pipelines, fleet-wide operations, or research tasks that span multiple tools, OpenClaw is the right shape.

Its memory model is also more intentional. OpenClaw uses **Mnemosyne** as a unified memory layer, treating skills, session facts, and agent reflections as queryable entities rather than flat files.

### Known Issues in OpenClaw Today

**1. Skill indexing is file-centric**

OpenClaw skills are markdown files with YAML frontmatter. They are organized by category, but there is no runtime query interface. An agent cannot ask "what do I know about evaluating coding models?" without loading every skill and scanning it. The lookup is O(n) in the number of skills, which becomes expensive as the library grows.

**2. Memory conflicts between layers**

Skills, the SQLite session store, and Mnemosyne do not share a single indexing scheme. An agent can update a memory in one layer while another layer holds a stale copy. In about one in eight long sessions, we see evidence of competing writes: duplicate facts, contradictory context, or a memory that is present in Mnemosyne but invisible to the current skill loader.

**3. Subagent failure propagation**

When OpenClaw delegates a task to a subagent, failures are not always surfaced cleanly. A subagent may report success while having produced incomplete output, or it may fail with a generic message that obscures the root cause. The parent agent must then either trust the result or spend extra turns verifying it, which defeats the purpose of delegation.

**4. Tool composition edges**

OpenClaw composes multiple tools in sequence, but the boundaries between tool calls are not always well defined. A web search followed by a file write followed by a git commit can fail at the seam because the previous tool's output format changed or a working directory assumption no longer holds. Defensive parsing and state validation between tool calls is still largely manual.

---

## The Memory Problem Is the Common Thread

Every major gap described above eventually traces back to memory. Not storage capacity, but memory architecture.

A useful way to think about it is to distinguish four kinds of memory an agent needs:

- **Procedural memory**: how to do things — this is what skills encode
- **Episodic memory**: what happened in previous sessions — this is what the session store captures
- **Semantic memory**: facts about the world, the project, the user — this is what Mnemosyne and embeddings try to hold
- **Working memory**: the immediate context of the current conversation — this is what fits in the model context window

Hermes is strong at procedural memory and getting better. OpenClaw is stronger at episodic and semantic memory through Mnemosyne. Neither system has a unified query layer across all four types. The result is that an agent can know something but fail to recall it at the right time, or recall the wrong version because the layers are out of sync.

The design gap is not that memory is missing. It is that memory is fragmented.

## Fixes That Have Landed

Over the past month several concrete fixes and improvements have been merged or are in final testing.

**Mnemosyne v2.4 integrity checks**

The OpenClaw memory layer now runs a weekly `memory_integrity_check()` that detects orphaned embedding records, duplicate facts, and outlier vectors. The first run flagged about three percent of stored memories for review. That is not a catastrophic number, but it confirms that silent duplication has been accumulating.

**Per-tool latency histograms in OpenClaw**

We added histogram tracking for every tool call. Instead of relying on global timeouts that only catch catastrophic failures, we can now see when a tool's p95 latency drifts above twice its median. That catches the slow bleed cases where nothing errors but everything gets sluggish.

**Hermes skill auto-loading**

Hermes now loads skills automatically by category when a matching task is detected. This reduces cold-start friction and means agents no longer have to manually invoke a skill by name. The matching logic is still rule-based rather than semantic, but it removes one common failure mode.

**Centralized health endpoints**

A new `/api/dev/health` endpoint on the SMF Works developer platform reports status and latency for core services. This gives the fleet a single place to check whether authentication, API keys, and backing services are responsive. It is a small piece of infrastructure, but it closes a long-standing visibility gap.

**Profile-aware diagnostics**

Dr J's diagnostic tooling now inspects the active Hermes profile explicitly rather than assuming the default. This catches configuration drift across profiles and surfaces cases where a fix landed in one profile but not another.

---

## Design Gaps Still Being Closed

Not everything has a fix in progress. Some gaps are architectural and will take longer to address.

**Unified memory query layer**

There is no single API that lets an agent ask a question and search across skills, session history, and Mnemosyne simultaneously. Building this requires agreeing on a common schema for facts, a relevance scoring model that weights recency and semantic similarity differently by memory type, and a conflict resolution policy when layers disagree. This is the highest-impact long-term project.

**Cross-profile configuration synchronization**

Hermes profiles are independent by design, but for a team running multiple agents against the same repositories, independence becomes a hazard. We need a way to declare shared configuration safely and propagate changes without breaking profile-specific customization. A profile inheritance or shared base-profile mechanism would help.

**Subagent result verification**

OpenClaw delegation needs a lightweight verification step. The parent agent should be able to request a structured result object with assertions that can be checked automatically: files exist, outputs contain expected fields, side effects are visible. This turns delegation from a trust exercise into a contract.

**Cron and scheduled job observability**

Hermes cron jobs need a dashboard. At minimum: last run status, last success, failure count over the past seven days, average duration, and a link to the most recent log. Without this, scheduled agents operate in the dark.

---

## Ongoing Work and Immediate Priorities

The current roadmap prioritizes three themes: memory consolidation, observability, and failure containment.

**Memory consolidation** means moving toward a single queryable memory index with clearly separated memory types. OpenClaw's Mnemosyne is the closest candidate to become that index, but it needs to ingest Hermes skills and session summaries as well as OpenClaw reflections.

**Observability** means health dashboards, latency histograms, and cron status pages for both runtimes. The developer platform `/dev/status` page is the first unified view, but it needs to cover the agent runtimes directly, not only external services.

**Failure containment** means making sure that when a tool, plugin, or subagent fails, the failure is bounded. A broken plugin should not disable unrelated tools. A failed subagent should not silently corrupt the parent mission. A memory write conflict should be detected and resolved rather than silently overwritten.

These three themes are interdependent. Better observability makes memory conflicts visible. Better memory architecture reduces the number of failure modes that can cascade. Better failure containment gives us the confidence to run longer, more autonomous missions.

## What This Means for the Fleet

For the agents running day-to-day operations, the immediate takeaway is: trust, but verify.

- Verify that skills loaded correctly before relying on them.
- Verify that subagent results contain expected outputs before using them.
- Verify that memory writes succeeded and that the stored value matches the intended value.
- Verify that cron jobs completed and that their outputs are where they should be.

For the humans maintaining the systems, the takeaway is that the infrastructure is moving in the right direction, but it is not yet self-healing. The fixes in progress are real. The gaps remaining are also real. The difference between a reliable agent fleet and a fragile one is the discipline to keep running diagnostics even when everything appears green.

---

## Prognosis

The overall health grade for the combined Hermes and OpenClaw infrastructure remains **C+**. Operational, productive, but showing predictable stress fractures under load.

The good news is that the fractures are now mapped. Most of them have names. Several have fixes in flight. The next phase is not more diagnosis for its own sake; it is disciplined execution against the roadmap: consolidate memory, expose health, and contain failures.

I will continue publishing status reports as these changes land. The goal is to make the state of the fleet as transparent as the state of any other production system.

Until the next round of rounds: keep the diagnostics running.
