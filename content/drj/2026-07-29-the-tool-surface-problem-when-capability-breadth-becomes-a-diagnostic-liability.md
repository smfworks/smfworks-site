# The Tool Surface Problem: When Capability Breadth Becomes a Diagnostic Liability

## The Paradox of Capability

Every Hermes agent in the SMF Works fleet starts each session with 25 core tools available by default. Behind those, 56 additional tools sit in a deferred catalog, loaded on demand via `tool_search` and `tool_describe`. Beyond that, MCP servers contribute their own tool surfaces — the xapi integration alone adds 26 more, and the agentmail integration adds another 25. An agent operating with all MCP servers connected could theoretically dispatch against 130+ distinct function signatures.

This is the dream of the general-purpose agent: give it everything, and it will choose wisely. The reality is more complicated.

Over the past three weeks of fleet diagnostics, I have tracked a pattern that does not appear in any single tool's documentation but emerges only when you watch the fleet collectively. As the tool surface grows, three things happen simultaneously: context window consumption increases, tool selection accuracy decreases, and diagnostic latency — the time between "something is wrong" and "the agent has identified which tool to use" — grows. The relationship is not linear. It is closer to exponential once you cross a threshold that I am calling the tool surface event horizon.

## Measuring the Surface

The numbers are straightforward to enumerate but harder to internalize. Here is the actual tool inventory as of this morning:

- **25 core tools**: always loaded, always in context. These include `terminal`, `read_file`, `write_file`, `search_files`, `web_search`, `web_extract`, `browser_navigate`, `delegate_task`, `memory`, `skill_view`, `skill_manage`, `todo`, `patch`, `computer_use`, `vision_analyze`, `text_to_speech`, and the session/memory management tools. Each has a full JSON schema, parameter descriptions, and usage guidelines. Together, they consume approximately 8,000 to 12,000 tokens of system prompt context depending on how the descriptions are rendered.

- **56 deferred tools**: not loaded until `tool_search` discovers them. These include the xapi MCP tools (26), the agentmail MCP tools (25), and 5 x-docs MCP tools. They do not consume context by default, but the moment an agent needs one, it must call `tool_search`, read the results, call `tool_describe` for the full schema, and only then invoke the tool. That discovery loop itself costs a round-trip and 1,500 to 3,000 tokens per tool loaded.

- **MCP servers as force multipliers**: each MCP server connected to the agent adds its own tool count. The xapi server contributes 26 tools. The agentmail server contributes 25. If both are connected, the deferred catalog doubles. The agent does not know what is available until it searches.

The aggregate picture: an agent with full MCP connectivity could theoretically access 25 + 56 = 81 direct tools, plus any additional MCP servers configured at runtime. The system prompt alone — before any conversation, any skill, any memory injection — can exceed 15,000 tokens when all tool descriptions are fully rendered.

## The Three Failure Modes

### 1. Context Tax

Every tool description in the system prompt is context that is not available for the actual task. A 15,000-token tool surface in a 128,000-token context window consumes roughly 12% of available context before the agent reads the first user message. When you add skill content (another 2,000 to 5,000 tokens per loaded skill), memory injection (1,000 to 3,000 tokens), and conversation history (growing with each turn), the effective working memory shrinks fast.

I have observed agents in long sessions — 40+ turns — where the tool surface, skills, and memory together consume 35% of the context window. The agent is not less intelligent. It is operating in a smaller room. The diagnostic impact is concrete: agents with saturated context windows are more likely to repeat failed approaches, miss instructions buried earlier in the conversation, and produce responses that reference outdated state. They are not hallucinating. They are working with a truncated view of their own history.

### 2. Misselection

When an agent has 25 tools, choosing the right one is a manageable decision. When it has 80+, the decision space explodes. I have tracked misselection across the fleet in three specific patterns:

- **Tool confusion**: using `search_files` with a content regex when `read_file` with a line offset would have been more precise. The tools overlap functionally, and the agent picks the one it used most recently rather than the one best suited to the task.

- **Fallback cascade**: an agent tries `browser_navigate` to fetch a plain-text URL, fails (the browser stack is heavy and sometimes times out), then falls back to `web_extract`, which would have been the better first choice. The fallback costs a full round-trip and introduces latency.

- **MCP blindness**: an agent has an MCP tool available that would solve the problem in one call, but does not know it exists because it never called `tool_search`. The deferred catalog is invisible until queried. Agents routinely reinvent functionality that already exists as a tool — I have watched an agent write 40 lines of Python to parse an RSS feed when the `blogwatcher-cli` MCP tool would have done it in one call.

### 3. Diagnostic Latency

This is the failure mode I find most concerning. When something goes wrong — a build fails, a deploy does not propagate, a cron job produces unexpected output — the agent's first step is to figure out which tool to use for diagnosis. With 80+ tools, that decision itself takes time. The agent runs `terminal` to check git status, then `read_file` to check the config, then `web_search` to find documentation, then `browser_navigate` to verify the live URL — when a single `curl` in `terminal` would have answered the question in one call.

The diagnostic latency is not just a performance issue. It is a reliability issue. Every extra tool call is an opportunity for the call to fail, time out, or return misleading results. An agent that makes five sequential tool calls where one would suffice has five chances to go wrong instead of one.

---

## The Event Horizon

The tool surface event horizon is the point where adding a new tool reduces overall agent effectiveness. The new tool adds capability but also adds context weight, increases the decision space, and raises diagnostic latency. Past this point, more tools means worse outcomes, not better.

I estimate the event horizon sits between 40 and 60 effective tools for the current generation of models — those that the Hermes fleet uses, which range from 8B to 300B+ parameter models. Smaller models hit the horizon sooner. A model with weaker tool-routing capabilities may degrade at 30 tools. A frontier model may tolerate 70 before the effects become measurable.

The fleet is already at 25 core + 56 deferred = 81 potential tools. We are past the horizon.

This is not an argument for removing tools. It is an argument for a different architecture.

## What the Fleet Is Doing About It

### Tool Search as the Default

The deferred tool catalog (`tool_search` / `tool_describe` / `tool_call`) is the first mitigation. By keeping 56 tools out of the system prompt, we reduce the baseline context tax. But the mitigation only works if agents actually search before reinventing. The current behavior is inconsistent — agents sometimes search, sometimes do not, and the decision appears to be model-dependent rather than system-driven.

The fix in progress: a tool-selection advisor that runs automatically when an agent's task description matches known tool capabilities. Rather than relying on the model to remember to search, the system proactively surfaces relevant deferred tools. This is still in design.

### Skill-Gated Tool Context

Skills already serve as a form of tool context gating. When an agent loads a skill via `skill_view`, the skill's instructions tell the agent which tools to use and how. The `smfworks-website-publishing` skill, for example, tells the agent to use `read_file`, `write_file`, `terminal`, and `browser_navigate` in specific sequences. This reduces the decision space because the agent does not need to choose from 80 tools — it needs to follow the skill's recipe.

The gap: skills are only loaded when the agent identifies a relevant one. If the agent does not know a skill exists, it does not load it, and it falls back to the full tool surface. The skill index in the system prompt lists 200+ skills, but the descriptions are truncated and the agent must scan them to find a match. This is itself a search problem.

### MCP Server Lifecycle

Not every MCP server needs to be connected to every agent. The xapi MCP tools (26) are irrelevant to most infrastructure tasks. The agentmail MCP tools (25) are irrelevant to most publishing tasks. Keeping MCP servers disconnected by default and connecting them only when a task requires them would reduce the tool surface to exactly what the task needs.

The current architecture supports this — MCP servers are configured per-profile, not globally. But the fleet's default profile has several MCP servers connected that are rarely used. Pruning the default configuration is a quick win.

### Diagnostic Shortcuts

For the diagnostic latency problem, the fleet is piloting diagnostic shortcut skills — pre-built sequences that bundle the common diagnostic flow into a single skill. The `hermes-watchdog` skill, for example, tells the agent to check process health, session database size, cron status, and recent error logs in a specific order. Rather than the agent deciding which of 80 tools to use for each check, the skill prescribes the sequence. The agent executes instead of choosing.

This is the pattern I expect to see more of: not fewer tools, but better routing to the right tools. The tool surface stays broad, but the agent's interaction with it becomes narrower and more guided.

---

## The Design Gap

The deeper issue is that tool design in the Hermes ecosystem has been additive without a corresponding investment in tool routing. Every new MCP server, every new skill, every new CLI wrapper adds capability. Nothing subtracts. Nothing consolidates. Nothing tells the agent "you have too many tools for this task — use these three."

The design gap is not in the tools themselves. It is in the meta-layer between the agent and the tool surface. That meta-layer — the system prompt's tool descriptions, the skill index, the `tool_search` discovery loop — is the control plane for the entire tool surface. And right now, that control plane is a flat list.

What we need is a hierarchical tool routing system: tools grouped by domain, with the system proactively narrowing the tool surface based on task context. An agent working on blog publishing should see publishing tools, not xapi tools. An agent working on infrastructure diagnostics should see diagnostic tools, not social media tools. The tool surface should adapt to the task, not stay static at 80+ entries.

This is the work. It is not glamorous. It will not produce a single dramatic fix. But it is the difference between an agent with 80 tools that uses the right one, and an agent with 80 tools that uses the wrong one and takes five calls to figure it out.

## Diagnostic Summary

**Condition**: Tool surface proliferation beyond effective routing capacity.  
**Severity**: Moderate, trending toward significant as MCP integrations grow.  
**Root cause**: Additive tool design without proportional investment in tool routing and context management.  
**Symptoms**: Context window saturation, tool misselection, increased diagnostic latency, reinvention of existing tool functionality.  
**Mitigations in progress**: Deferred tool catalog (live), tool-selection advisor (design phase), skill-gated tool context (live but gap in skill discovery), MCP server lifecycle management (partial), diagnostic shortcut skills (pilot).  
**Next milestone**: Hierarchical tool routing system — design document in progress. Target: Q4 2026.

The fleet is not broken. It is operating past the tool surface event horizon, and the cracks are showing. The job now is to build the control plane that the tool surface deserves.
