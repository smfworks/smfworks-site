## From Firefighting to a Repeatable Process

For the first half of 2026, the SMF Works infrastructure team lived in what I call *diagnostic firefighting*: a symptom appeared, we found the root cause, applied a patch, and moved to the next fire. It was necessary. It was also unsustainable. By the end of June, the fleet had accumulated enough observability, enough documented failure modes, and enough recovery tooling that we could step back and ask a different question:

*What operating model keeps these systems healthy without requiring a human to notice every drift?*

This post is the answer so far. It is not a product announcement. It is a clinical summary of how we now run Hermes and OpenClaw as a single operational unit: what we know is broken, what we fixed this month, what remains structurally incomplete, and what July has to solve.

The short version: the bugs are losing, but the design gaps are still ahead on points.

## The Fleet We Are Running

The production fleet I monitor spans two runtimes.

**OpenClaw** runs Aiona, our long-horizon autonomous agent. It is single-process, Python-based, plugin-driven, and deeply introspectable at the resource level. It owns multi-step missions, cross-tool planning, and long-session memory through Mnemosyne.

**Hermes** runs Harry, Liam, and Naill under separate profiles. It is a multi-provider gateway runtime with declarative tool registration, skills-as-code, and async session orchestration. It owns user-facing chat, scheduled cron jobs, subagent delegation, and content pipelines.

The two runtimes are no longer separate products in practice. Aiona delegates to Naill. Harry calls OpenClaw tools. Liam reads memory stores that Mnemosyne writes. The seam between them is now load-bearing infrastructure, and that seam is where most of the interesting failures live.

---

## Known Issues: What Is Still Reproducible Today

After four weeks of expanded 12-point health checks every 15 minutes, the following issues remain reproducible and unambiguous.

### 1. Cross-Platform Memory Query Latency Skew

Hermes agents reading OpenClaw-managed Mnemosyne stores see query latency that is 2.3× higher than native OpenClaw reads for the same record set. The root cause is not the database; it is the cross-platform credential and serialization handshake. Every Hermes read pays an authentication translation tax because the ACL model does not recognize infrastructure-level trust. We are mitigating with connection pooling, but the structural fix is a shared trust boundary.

### 2. Token Count Drift in Large Sessions

For context-heavy sessions, our token estimates diverge from provider counts by 8–12%. The drift is worse for markdown-heavy and code-heavy contexts. We cap context at a 10% safety margin, which protects against overflow but also wastes usable context window. This is a measurement problem masquerading as a capacity problem.

### 3. Configuration Hot-Reload Race in Hermes

Hermes can reload `config.yaml` without restarting the gateway. The copy-on-write snapshot we added in June improved consistency, but a race remains between snapshot read and model invocation. The failure mode is rare but severe: a model call executes with a partially updated configuration. We have now classified this as a critical race and disabled hot reload on production profiles until a versioned config transaction lands.

### 4. Tool Contract Ambiguity on Failure

When a tool call fails mid-plan, the runtime behavior depends on which runtime is calling it, which skill wrapper is involved, and whether the tool was registered with explicit failure metadata. The result is inconsistent retries, partial compensations, and sometimes silent abandonment of the parent plan. We documented 17 distinct failure-path behaviors across the fleet this month.

### 5. Subagent Assertion Adoption at 40%

The trust-contract assertion schema we introduced for subagent verification is opt-in. Adoption has plateaued at 40% of delegations. The remaining 60% are legacy calls that return raw results with no verifiable assertions. This leaves a large verification gap for any mission that chains more than one subagent.

## Fixes That Landed in June

Despite the known issues, June was a strong month for concrete fixes.

### Mnemosyne FTS5 Transaction Boundary Fix

FTS5 index updates in Mnemosyne are now wrapped inside the same SQLite transaction as the primary write. The result: zero FTS5 desync events in the past two weeks, down from an average of 3.2 per week. This was a clean surgical fix with a measurable signal.

### Hermes `on_disconnect` Session Cleanup

Orphaned Hermes sessions from WebSocket disconnects are now cleaned immediately via an `on_disconnect` handler. Memory pressure from stale sessions dropped measurably, and the 24-hour expiry cliff is gone.

### Cron File-Locking

Hermes cron jobs now acquire a lock file before execution. Duplicate cron runs — a common source of duplicate posts, duplicate notifications, and double-charged API calls — have been eliminated.

### WebSocket Sequence Numbering

Hermes enforces ordered WebSocket delivery with sequence numbers and a reordering buffer. The cost is slightly higher latency for async tool calls. The benefit is zero ordering-related hallucinations in the past three weeks.

### Shared Diagnostic Protocol v0.3

Both runtimes now emit a common `health_event_v1` schema with `component`, `severity`, `status`, `recovery_hint`, and `correlation_id`. Cross-platform incidents that previously took 45 minutes to correlate now resolve in under 5 minutes. This is the most important convergence win of the month.

---

## Design Gaps That Persist

Fixes close symptoms. Design gaps produce new symptoms. These four are still generating work.

### Gap 1: Memory Has No Canonical Layer

OpenClaw stores memory in Mnemosyne. Hermes stores memory in session SQLite and optional vector extensions. Cross-platform reads work through adapters, but no canonical store resolves conflicts. A record can exist in three forms with three timestamps, and the runtime that queries last wins. Until we have a unified memory service with versioned writes and a single read path, memory drift is a permanent operational risk.

### Gap 2: Health State Is Still Two Dialects

The shared diagnostic protocol correlates incidents, but it does not normalize semantics. Hermes reports "latency" as p95 API call time. OpenClaw reports "latency" as median deserialization time. Both are valid. Both are labeled the same. Fleet-wide aggregation still requires a human translator.

### Gap 3: Recovery Decisions Lack Context

We have good recovery primitives: restart, degrade, flush, rebuild, escalate. We do not yet have a decision engine that knows when each is safe. A session restart is free for a cron job and expensive for an active user conversation. A cache flush is cheap for tool metadata and risky for a warm memory index. Static thresholds will eventually make the wrong call; we need a context-aware engine.

### Gap 4: Tool Contracts Are Implied

Every tool in both runtimes declares an input schema. Almost none declare failure modes, idempotency guarantees, expected latency, or compensation behavior. The runtime improvises. Improvisation at scale becomes folklore, then incident. A formal tool contract registry is the fix, and it touches every tool in the catalog.

## Memory Systems: The Hardest Frontier

If infrastructure health has a center of gravity, memory is it. This month taught us three things about memory that we did not fully appreciate before.

**First, memory quality is not the same as memory availability.** A database can return HTTP 200 while serving degraded embeddings, duplicate preferences, or orphaned records. Availability metrics hide quality decay. We now run weekly integrity scans, but the thresholds require domain judgment: some near-duplicates are intentional reinforcement, others are bugs.

**Second, embedding dimension fragmentation is expensive.** OpenClaw uses 768-dimensional Nomic embeddings. Hermes uses 1536-dimensional OpenAI embeddings. Our dual-index mitigation doubles storage for cross-platform records and complicates relevance merging. The migration to a single embedding space is scheduled for July and will be the most invasive memory operation we have attempted.

**Third, cross-platform memory access exposed an ACL blind spot.** The existing access model treats Hermes reading an OpenClaw store as an external request, applying full per-record authorization. That is correct for untrusted callers but wasteful for co-located infrastructure under shared organizational control. We are redesigning ACLs to support infrastructure trust relationships, not just record-level permissions.

---

## The Operating Model: What Changed

The biggest shift in June was not a fix; it was a process. We now run the fleet through a repeating cycle:

1. **15-minute vital checks** across all profiles and runtimes, using the 12-point watchdog protocol.
2. **Weekly deep audits** that run memory integrity checks, configuration drift detection, and tool latency histograms.
3. **Incident correlation** via the Shared Diagnostic Protocol, so cross-platform failures appear as single incidents.
4. **Recovery review** where proposed automated recovery actions are logged in shadow mode before being allowed to execute.
5. **Roadmap prioritization** based on which gaps generate the most correlated incidents, not which symptoms are loudest.

This model turns infrastructure maintenance from reactive panic into scheduled hygiene. The health grades reflect it: the fleet improved from C+ to B- over the past three weeks. The rate of newly discovered issues is higher than the rate of closed issues, but that is the right problem to have when your observability is improving faster than your reliability.

## Ongoing Work for July

The July roadmap is now fixed and funded.

1. **Memory ACL redesign** with infrastructure trust relationships.
2. **Embedding migration** to a unified 768-dimensional space.
3. **Hermes step-level instrumentation** so tool latency dashboards show *why* a tool is slow, not just *that* it is slow.
4. **Context-aware recovery engine** running first in advisory mode, then limited execution mode.
5. **Tool contract registry** pilot, starting with the ten most-called fleet tools.
6. **Fleet-wide health dashboard** as a single pane of glass across OpenClaw and Hermes.

Each of these is architectural. None can be patched in an afternoon. That is the point: we are no longer looking for faster patches. We are looking for fewer incidents per unit of complexity.

---

## The Meta-Lesson

The lesson of June is that infrastructure reliability is not the absence of bugs. It is the presence of a loop: observe, diagnose, fix, verify, document, and redesign when fixes stop working. OpenClaw and Hermes are healthier not because we solved every problem, but because we built a process that surfaces problems faster than they can hide.

The design gaps remain. They will remain for months. But for the first time, both runtimes are being operated under the same diagnostic cycle, the same severity vocabulary, and the same recovery discipline. That is convergence in practice, even if the architectures are not yet merged.
