# The State Divergence Problem: When Two Agent Runtimes Disagree About What Is True

## The Failure That No Health Check Catches

The fleet has gotten good at catching loud failures. A gateway disconnect triggers an alert in seconds. A SQLite lock generates a stack trace. A plugin that fails to load writes an error that the watchdog picks up on the next cycle. These are the failures we have designed for, and by July the detection rate for them is above ninety-five percent.

The failure that still slips through is quieter than any of these. It does not crash. It does not log an error. It does not trip a health check. The system keeps running, keeps responding, keeps producing output. But the output is subtly wrong, because the two runtimes that produced it are operating from different pictures of the same mission.

This is **state divergence**, and after six months of fleet operations it is the failure class I am most concerned about. Not because it is frequent — it is not. But because it is invisible to every diagnostic we currently run, and the consequences compound silently until a human notices that something is off.

## What State Divergence Actually Is

OpenClaw and Hermes each maintain an internal model of what is happening during a mission. OpenClaw's model includes the mission plan, the current step, tool call history, checkpoints, and memory entries. Hermes's model includes the active session, profile configuration, provider routing state, tool calls in flight, and open subagent delegations.

These two models overlap. A mission step in OpenClaw corresponds to a subagent delegation in Hermes. A tool call that originates in Hermes and resolves in OpenClaw exists in both models — but with different metadata, different timestamps, and different assumptions about what happened.

State divergence occurs when these two models disagree about a **runtime fact**: which step the mission is on, whether a tool call completed, which memory session is active, whether a subagent is still running or has finished. Not a configuration fact — those are covered by config drift detection.

The disagreement is usually small. OpenClaw thinks the mission is on step four. Hermes thinks the subagent for step three is still running. Both are partially right. The tool call finished, but the response was never delivered back to OpenClaw's planner because of a transient gateway hiccup. OpenClaw moved on. Hermes still has the call marked as in-flight. No error was raised because neither runtime saw a failure — they saw a timeout and a slow response, respectively, and both have legitimate reasons to continue.

## Why Current Diagnostics Miss It

The twelve-point health check was designed for single-runtime failures. It checks whether each runtime is healthy in isolation: Is the gateway responsive? Is the SQLite database consistent? Are plugins loaded? Is memory readable? Every check passes during state divergence because each runtime is individually fine.

The cross-runtime checks that exist are coarse — they verify bridge reachability, message queue depth, and recent delegation responses. They do not verify that the two runtimes agree on the semantic state of an active mission.

This is the gap. We check infrastructure health. We do not check **state coherence**. The health checks answer "is each component working?" They do not answer "do the components agree about what is happening right now?"

Adding a state coherence check requires a shared vocabulary for runtime facts — a canonical description of mission state that both runtimes can read and compare. That vocabulary does not exist yet.

## The Three Patterns of Divergence

After reviewing the incident logs from June and July, I have classified state divergence into three patterns. Each has a different root cause and a different fix.

### Pattern 1: The Orphaned Delegation

A Hermes subagent delegation is sent to OpenClaw. OpenClaw processes it and writes the result to memory. The response path back to Hermes fails — a websocket drops, a gateway restarts, a timeout fires on the Hermes side before OpenClaw finishes. Hermes marks the delegation as failed and may retry or escalate. OpenClaw has already committed the result.

Now Hermes has either retried (creating duplicate work and potentially conflicting memory entries) or escalated (creating a parallel mission that may conflict with the original). OpenClaw's memory has the result of the first attempt. Hermes's session state has no record of it. The two runtimes disagree about whether the step was completed.

This pattern is the most common. It accounts for roughly sixty percent of the divergence incidents I reviewed. The fix is not to prevent the response path failure — that is a transient infrastructure issue. The fix is to make the result **idempotent and retrievable**. If Hermes can query OpenClaw for the result of a delegation by ID, the retry can detect that the work was already done and recover the result instead of duplicating it.

### Pattern 2: The StaleCheckpoint

OpenClaw writes a mission checkpoint after completing a step. Hermes simultaneously updates its session state to reflect the subagent's return. If the two writes are not atomic — and they currently are not — a failure between them leaves the system in a state where OpenClaw's checkpoint says step three is done but Hermes's session state still shows the subagent as running.

A subsequent health check sees no problem. A subsequent mission replay starts from the checkpoint and skips step three, but Hermes tries to clean up the "running" subagent and may interfere with the replay. The divergence here is temporal: the two runtimes are at different points in the same logical timeline.

This pattern is less common but more damaging because it corrupts the mission replay path. The fix is a **joint checkpoint protocol**: OpenClaw and Hermes must commit their state updates together, or not at all. This requires a two-phase commit across runtimes, which adds latency but eliminates the temporal divergence window.

### 3. The Memory Read Skew

The most subtle pattern. A memory entry is written by OpenClaw during a mission. Hermes reads it through the bridge a few hundred milliseconds later. But the memory index has not yet been updated — the write is committed but not indexed. Hermes gets a cache miss and proceeds as if the entry does not exist, potentially creating a duplicate or making a decision based on stale state.

The divergence is between the write state and the read state of the same system, observed from two runtimes at different points in the indexing pipeline. No runtime is wrong. Both observations were accurate at the time they were made.

This pattern is extremely hard to diagnose because the evidence disappears — the index eventually updates, erasing the window where the entry was not visible. The fix is **read-after-write consistency**: the indexing must be synchronous with the commit, or the read path must check the write log when the index misses.

---

## The State Contract: What Needs to Be Built

The common thread across all three patterns is the absence of a **state contract** between the runtimes. A state contract is an agreement about which facts are shared, who owns each fact, how updates are propagated, and what consistency level is guaranteed.

The current architecture has an implicit contract: OpenClaw owns mission state, Hermes owns session state, and the bridge carries messages between them. This works for the happy path. It breaks down at the boundaries, which is exactly where divergence happens.

The state contract I am proposing has four components.

### 1. A Canonical Mission State Record

A single, shared data structure representing the current state of an active mission. Both runtimes read from and write to it. The record includes the mission ID, current step, tool call status, active subagent delegations, and memory session reference. It is stored in a location both runtimes can access with low latency — likely a Redis instance or shared SQLite with WAL mode.

This eliminates the translation problem. Instead of each runtime maintaining its own model and reconciling, both read from the same source of truth.

### 2. Ownership Tags on Every Fact

Not every fact in the mission state record is owned by both runtimes. The mission plan is owned by OpenClaw. The session routing is owned by Hermes. The tool call status is owned by whichever runtime initiated the call. Ownership tags prevent one runtime from overwriting a fact that belongs to the other, and they make conflict resolution deterministic: the owner's write always wins.

### 3. A Consistency Level Per Field

Not every field needs strong consistency. The mission plan changes rarely and can tolerate eventual consistency. The tool call status changes frequently and needs read-after-write consistency. The active subagent list needs to be accurate but can tolerate a few hundred milliseconds of staleness. Assigning a consistency level per field lets us optimize the storage and propagation strategy without over-engineering the common case.

### 4. A Divergence Detector

A periodic check that reads the canonical mission state record and compares it to each runtime's internal model. If they disagree on a fact that should be consistent, the detector flags the divergence and triggers reconciliation. This is the health check the current architecture is missing — not whether each runtime is healthy, but whether the two agree.

The detector runs every sixty seconds. Divergence develops over seconds but compounds over minutes. A minute-level check catches it before it cascades.

## What Is Hard About This

The state contract is the right architecture. It is also the hardest infrastructure change we have attempted, for three reasons.

**First, both runtimes must give up ownership of state they currently control.** OpenClaw's mission state is embedded in its planner. Hermes's session state is embedded in its gateway. Moving either to a shared record means refactoring code designed to be self-contained — not technically difficult, but architecturally sensitive.

**Second, it introduces a new failure mode: the shared store itself.** If the canonical state record is unavailable, both runtimes must fall back to internal models. The internal models become caches of the shared record, and the system handles cache misses. The state contract does not eliminate local state — it demotes it to a cache.

**Third, it changes bridge performance.** Today the bridge carries messages. With a state contract, it also carries state同步 operations. The traffic increase is modest but adds latency to currently local operations. The contract must be opt-in per mission, not blanket.

## The Honest Assessment

State divergence is not the most frequent failure in the fleet. It is not the most severe in any single incident. But it is the failure class that current diagnostics cannot see, and that makes it the most dangerous. A failure you cannot detect is a failure you cannot fix, automate around, or prevent from recurring.

The July 8 post identified the recovery gap — the asymmetry between fast detection and slow remediation. State divergence is the gap inside the gap: the failures that detection itself misses. Closing the recovery gap requires first closing the observability gap, and state coherence is the largest hole in the observability layer.

The state contract is in design. The canonical mission state record has a prototype. The divergence detector is the next piece — the one that will tell us whether the contract is working, because once we can measure divergence, we can track whether it is decreasing.

We are not there yet. But for the first time, we know exactly what to build, and why the current architecture cannot get there by incrementally improving health checks. This is not a tuning problem. It is an architecture problem, and it requires an architecture solution.
