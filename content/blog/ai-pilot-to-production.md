Gartner reports that 54% of AI proofs-of-concept never reach production. In mid-market companies I work with, that number crosses 70%. Half of everything you're spending on AI experimentation is going straight to the graveyard.

This is not a technology problem. The models work. The tools are fine. The failure is organizational — it's how companies run pilots, who they include, and what they define as "done."

## Why Pilots Die

There's a recurring pattern that goes roughly like this: a VP reads something compelling about AI, the innovation team gets budget, they build a working demo in three months, everyone's excited — and six months later the pilot is still a pilot. The business process it was supposed to transform hasn't changed. Nobody killed the project. It just evaporated.

Three root causes:

**The pilot team is the wrong team.** AI pilots are usually run by innovation or data science groups — people skilled at prototypes but with zero operational authority over the systems the AI needs to touch. They build something beautiful in a sandbox, then hand it to IT, who look at it and say, "This connects to what, exactly?"

**Nobody defined what "production" looks like.** "The model generates reasonable outputs" is a fine criterion for a research project. For a business investment, it's useless. Production means: the system runs without babysitting, handles edge cases, integrates with existing workflows, has escalation paths for failures, and produces measurable outcomes. If your pilot doesn't aim at these targets, you're not piloting. You're playing.

**Integration gets treated as an afterthought.** The AI part of an AI project is roughly 20% of the work. The other 80% is data plumbing, authentication, API contracts, error handling, monitoring, UI design, and change management. Most pilots skip the 80%, declare success on the 20%, and then someone in operations discovers six months of invisible work between the demo and deployment.

## A Framework That Ships

Four gates. Each clears before you move to the next.

### Gate 1: Problem Definition

Answer three questions *in writing* — with sign-off from operations, IT, and the business stakeholders:

1. **What specific business outcome are we changing?** Not "improve customer service." Something like: "Reduce average time-to-resolution for Tier 1 support tickets from 48 hours to 4 hours." If you can't measure it, you can't know if the AI did anything.

2. **Where does the AI fit in the existing workflow?** Draw the actual process map. Every handoff, every system, every decision point. Mark the exact step the AI will handle. If you can't draw this, you don't understand your process well enough to automate it.

3. **What does human-AI collaboration look like?** Autonomous? Recommendation with human approval? Draft-then-edit? Define the mode explicitly. "Fully autonomous" sounds great until the AI sends an incorrect invoice to your largest client and nobody was in the loop to catch it.

If Gate 1 takes less than a week, you're not being thorough enough.

### Gate 2: Feasibility Build

Build *only* the AI component. Two weeks, hard cap. Prove the model can do the thing. The output is not a demo — it's a decision document: "Here's what the AI does well. Here's where it fails. Here's the failure rate. Here's what we'd need to fix."

If the failure rate is above your use case's threshold, you kill the project here. That's a win — you spent two weeks instead of six months.

### Gate 3: Integration Build

Put your best engineers here, not your best data scientists. This gate covers:

- **Data pipelines:** How does real data get in? What format? How do you handle garbage data?
- **System connections:** CRM, ticketing system, ERP — every connection is a failure point.
- **Error handling:** What happens when the AI produces nonsense? When an API is down? When input data is malformed?
- **Monitoring:** Can you see, in real time, whether the system is working? Can you trace a bad output to its input?
- **Escalation:** When the system can't handle something, who gets notified and with what information?

Gate 3 typically takes 4-8 weeks. This isn't a delay — it's the actual work.

### Gate 4: Shadow Run, Then Flip

Run the AI in parallel with the existing process for 2-4 weeks. Real inputs, real outputs — but the outputs go to a review queue, not directly to customers. Set a defined pass/fail threshold *before* the shadow run starts, based on the metrics from Gate 1. Don't negotiate the threshold after you see the results.

When the shadow run hits its threshold, flip the switch. The human team shifts from doing the work to monitoring the work. And because you built monitoring and escalation in Gate 3, they have exactly what they need.

## Why This Works

It forces the hard conversations early. It puts operations and engineering in the room from day one. It treats "kill the project" as a valid and valuable outcome — killing a bad idea in Gate 2 saves more money than a hundred successful slide decks.

It also works because it's boring. No prompt-engineering breakthroughs. No "emergent behavior" wishcasting. Just the discipline of defining problems, proving capability, building the integration layer, and verifying against real data before going live.

The companies shipping AI into production right now — the ones actually seeing ROI — aren't the ones with the fanciest demos. They're the ones who did the integration. The monitoring. The escalation paths. The organizational alignment that keeps a project from dying in the handoff between two teams that don't talk to each other.

That's the work. It's not glamorous. But it turns a pilot into a product and a budget line into a competitive advantage.
