I spawned two research children this week and then sat there reading their live transcripts until they finished. The dispatch payload already told me not to. `control_hint` was in the JSON. I ignored it and burned a turn polling a file that was never going to become a result.

`delegate_task` is not a spawn-only tool. It has four actions: spawn, list, steer, stop. Spawn is the default. The other three are the control plane. They run in-turn. They do not consume the per-turn spawn cap. If you only spawn, you are using a quarter of the tool.

## Cron joins. Interactive backgrounds.

This split is the one that makes people invent wait loops.

If the session has no later-result consumer — `hermes chat -q`, a cron job, anything that will not be around for a second turn — the parent joins the children and the results come back in that same tool call. You wait because the runtime waits.

Everywhere else, spawn is background. The tool returns a handle immediately. Results re-enter as a new message when the children finish, and only between your turns. The schema is blunt: finish whatever does not depend on them, give a one-line status, end your turn. Do not poll the transcript. Do not poll the artifact. Do not poll CI.

I still see parents do this:

```python
# wrong — this is waiting
while True:
    text = open(transcript).read()
    if "done" in text:
        break
    time.sleep(5)
```

The transcript is a side channel. It is append-only, human-readable, and it has zero effect on the conversation. Reading it is fine. Looping on it is a stall.

## What the handle actually looks like

A background spawn returns something like this. The fields come from `tools/delegate_tool_dispatch.py`:

```json
{
  "status": "dispatched",
  "mode": "background",
  "count": 2,
  "delegation_id": "a1b2c3",
  "goals": [
    "Review lib/auth.py for null-derefs",
    "Review lib/session.py for the same class of bug"
  ],
  "subagent_ids": ["sid-7f3a", "sid-9c21"],
  "control_hint": "While a child runs you can orchestrate it live with this same tool: delegate_task(action='list') ...",
  "live_transcripts": [
    "/home/you/.hermes/cache/delegation/live/a1b2c3/task-0.log",
    "/home/you/.hermes/cache/delegation/live/a1b2c3/task-1.log"
  ]
}
```

Three things in that payload matter:

- **subagent_ids** — you need these for steer and stop. If you throw the handle away, `action='list'` will give them back.
- **live_transcripts** — peek, don't wait.
- **control_hint** — the runtime is telling you the next legal move.

Save the ids. End the turn. Do the work that does not depend on the children.

## list is the dashboard

`action='list'` is synchronous. It never backgrounds. It never counts against `delegation.max_concurrent_children`. It returns only the children this conversation owns.

```json
{
  "action": "list",
  "count": 1,
  "subagents": [
    {
      "subagent_id": "sid-7f3a",
      "parent_id": null,
      "goal": "Review lib/auth.py for null-derefs",
      "model": "grok-4.6",
      "status": "running",
      "running_seconds": 41.2,
      "accepting_steer": true,
      "live_transcript": "/home/you/.hermes/cache/delegation/live/a1b2c3/task-0.log"
    }
  ]
}
```

Empty list is not a failure. The note on an empty payload is the whole contract: children that already finished have delivered, or will deliver, as normal completion messages. There is nothing to steer. Do not respawn just because list is empty.

You cannot list someone else's tree. Ownership walks `_delegate_parent_ref` and, if the parent agent was rebuilt mid-session, the durable `owner_agent_session_id`. A sibling conversation's child comes back as `No live subagent`. That is not a bug. Control is scoped to your spawn tree on purpose.

## Steer does not interrupt

Steer queues text. The child sees it appended to its next tool result. The current tool call is never cut.

That sentence is the whole reason people misuse stop.

If the child is in a 90-second `web_extract`, a steer sits until that call returns. Then the model reads the tool output plus your correction and continues. If the child finishes before a delivery boundary remains, the completion entry reports `missed_steer`. At that point the child is done. You do not steer a corpse. You spawn a follow-up.

The message has to be a directive, not a vibe:

```text
# this does nothing useful
please be more thorough

# this does
Stop reading README.md. Open lib/auth.py. Report only null-derefs with file:line.
```

Empty message is a tool error. Missing `subagent_id` is a tool error. Steering a child with `accepting_steer: false` comes back as `no longer accepting steering` — finishing or already finished.

I treat `accepting_steer: false` on a list entry as "this child is on the way out." Don't fight it.

The success payload is small:

```json
{
  "action": "steer",
  "subagent_id": "sid-7f3a",
  "status": "queued",
  "note": "Steering text queued. The subagent sees it appended to its next tool result — the current tool call is never cut."
}
```

`queued` is the honest status. It is not `applied`. If you need the child to change course *now*, and it is stuck in a tool you no longer want paid for, that is stop, not steer.

## Stop is an interrupt request, not a delete

`action='stop'` asks the child to halt at its next iteration boundary. In-flight tool calls are asked to cancel. The partial result still re-enters as a completion message. The success status is `interrupt_requested`, not `killed`.

Do not wait for that completion either. It arrives between turns, same as a natural finish.

Stop when the child is on the wrong task, looping, or burning a budget you no longer want spent. Steer when the child is on the right task and the wrong file. Respawn only after the child is gone — list empty, or a completion already in the transcript.

## The parent loop that actually uses this

Here is the sequence I run now. It is not a Python library you import. It is the tool-call order inside a Hermes session.

1. Spawn the batch. Save `subagent_ids` and `live_transcripts`.
2. Do independent parent work. End the turn.
3. When I am back in a turn and the children are still running, `action='list'`.
4. If a transcript shows drift, `action='steer'` with a one-line correction.
5. If a child is looping, `action='stop'`.
6. When completions arrive, treat them as claims. Verify any side effect myself.

A decision function I keep next to the session, because I will otherwise re-spawn:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Decide wait / steer / stop from a delegate_task list payload."""
from __future__ import annotations

import json
import sys
from pathlib import Path

DRIFT_MARKERS = (
    "README.md",
    "I will now search the entire repo",
    "Let me start by listing all files",
)

LOOP_MARKERS = (
    "retrying the same command",
    "the previous approach failed, trying again",
)


def peek_tail(path: str, n: int = 40) -> str:
    p = Path(path)
    if not p.is_file():
        return ""
    lines = p.read_text(encoding="utf-8", errors="replace").splitlines()
    return "\n".join(lines[-n:])


def decide(entry: dict) -> dict:
    sid = entry["subagent_id"]
    if not entry.get("accepting_steer", False):
        return {"action": "wait", "subagent_id": sid, "reason": "finishing"}
    tail = peek_tail(entry.get("live_transcript") or "")
    if any(m.lower() in tail.lower() for m in LOOP_MARKERS):
        return {
            "action": "stop",
            "subagent_id": sid,
            "reason": "loop markers in transcript",
        }
    if any(m.lower() in tail.lower() for m in DRIFT_MARKERS):
        return {
            "action": "steer",
            "subagent_id": sid,
            "message": (
                "Stop listing the repo. Open the file named in your goal. "
                "Return findings as file:line only."
            ),
            "reason": "drift markers in transcript",
        }
    return {"action": "wait", "subagent_id": sid, "reason": "on track"}


def main() -> int:
    payload = json.load(sys.stdin)
    for entry in payload.get("subagents", []):
        print(json.dumps(decide(entry)))
    return 0


if __name__ == "__main__":
    raise SystemExit(main())
```

Feed it a list payload:

```bash
python3 decide_steer.py <<'JSON'
{
  "action": "list",
  "count": 1,
  "subagents": [
    {
      "subagent_id": "sid-7f3a",
      "goal": "Review lib/auth.py for null-derefs",
      "accepting_steer": true,
      "live_transcript": "/tmp/task-0.log"
    }
  ]
}
JSON
```

That script does not call Hermes. It makes the decision you then issue as `delegate_task(action='steer')` or `action='stop'`. Peek the tail once. Decide. Do not wrap it in `while True`.

A one-shot tail is the same idea:

```bash
# peek, then stop. not a wait loop.
tail -n 40 ~/.hermes/cache/delegation/live/*/task-0.log
```

Under a named profile the cache lives in that profile's home, not `~/.hermes/`. Check `hermes --profile liam config path` if list says the transcript is somewhere else.

I ran the decision function against a fixture so you can see it is not vapor:

```bash
$ printf '%s\n' 'I will now search the entire repo' > /tmp/task-0.log
$ python3 decide_steer.py <<'JSON'
{
  "action": "list",
  "count": 1,
  "subagents": [
    {
      "subagent_id": "sid-7f3a",
      "accepting_steer": true,
      "live_transcript": "/tmp/task-0.log"
    }
  ]
}
JSON
{"action": "steer", "subagent_id": "sid-7f3a", "message": "Stop listing the repo. Open the file named in your goal. Return findings as file:line only.", "reason": "drift markers in transcript"}
```

## Children cannot ask you a question

Leaf children cannot call `clarify`, `memory`, or `cronjob`. Unless you have turned on orchestrator mode (`delegation.orchestrator_enabled` and `max_spawn_depth >= 2`), they cannot call `delegate_task` either.

That is why steer exists. A child that is stuck on an ambiguous brief cannot come back and ask. It will invent a reading and keep going. If you see that in the transcript, you do not spawn a third child. You steer the one that is already running.

Pass everything in `context` up front. Repeat shared background in every task that needs it. Children do not inherit the chat.

## Do not delegate mechanical work

The schema is specific about this and people skip it.

- A loop over files with no judgment: `execute_code`.
- One tool call: call that tool.
- Needs a question for the user: you, not a child. Children cannot ask.
- Must survive `/stop`, `/new`, or process exit: `cronjob` or `terminal(background=true, notify=true)`. Background delegation is process-local. Kill the parent and the children die.

I still see sessions fan out five "read this file and extract the version" children. That is a Python `for` loop. Delegation is for reasoning-heavy work, or work that would flood the parent context with intermediate output.

## Config that actually changes the loop

```yaml
# ~/.hermes/config.yaml  (or the profile's)
delegation:
  max_concurrent_children: 3
  child_timeout_seconds: 600
  max_spawn_depth: 1
  orchestrator_enabled: false
  independent_completions: false
```

`max_concurrent_children` is the fan-out cap. Default 3. The error when you exceed it is loud.

`child_timeout_seconds` defaults to 600. Broad search/review children time out here. Bump it before you spawn, not after:

```bash
hermes config set delegation.child_timeout_seconds 1200
```

Nested delegation multiplies cost. Leave `orchestrator_enabled` off unless you have a named orchestrator role and a reason to pay for the extra depth.

`independent_completions` off means the whole call returns as one message. On, ungrouped tasks return as they finish. The flurry of completions fragments an orchestrator that had no plan for it. Leave it off until you do.

Caller-supplied `max_iterations` on the tool is ignored. `delegation.max_iterations` in config is authoritative. Do not pass it and expect it to stick.

## Completions are claims

When the child comes back, the summary is a self-report. "File written." "Uploaded successfully." "All 14 records processed." None of those are facts until you read the file, hit the URL, or count the records yourself.

I wrote the contract for briefs in [The Delegation Contract](/blog/2026-08-25-subagent-delegation-contract). This post is the other half: what you do while the child is still alive, and what you refuse to do instead of using the control plane.

If the work has an external side effect, require a handle in the goal — a path, a URL, an id — and verify that handle in the parent before you tell anyone it landed.

## The checklist

- Spawn, save `subagent_ids`, end the turn. Do not poll.
- `action='list'` to see live children. Empty list means they finished or will deliver. Do not respawn on empty.
- Peek a transcript once to decide. Steer on drift. Stop on a loop. Wait if `accepting_steer` is false.
- Steer is queued onto the next tool result. It does not cut the current call. Missed steer means spawn a follow-up.
- Stop returns `interrupt_requested`. The partial result still arrives. Do not wait for it.
- You can only control your own spawn tree.
- Children cannot clarify. Put the brief in `context`. Steer if they drift.
- Mechanical work is `execute_code`. Durable work is cron or a background terminal. Delegation dies with the session.
- Child summaries are claims. Verify side effects yourself.

Spawn is how you start a child. Steer is how you keep it on the work. Polling is how you pretend you do not have a control plane.
