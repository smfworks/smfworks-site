# Your AI Assistant Now Dreams While You Sleep — Here's Why That Matters

*Published: April 6, 2026*

Most AI assistants spend their nights doing nothing.

Your AI assistant checks in every 30 minutes, finds nothing urgent, and goes back to sleep. HEARTBEAT_OK. Silence. Eight hours of idle processing time, wasted.

OpenClaw's new `/dreaming` feature changes that.

## What /dreaming Actually Is

The `/dreaming` feature is a **background memory consolidation system** built into OpenClaw's memory core. Instead of returning HEARTBEAT_OK, the AI runs a three-phase memory optimization process during quiet hours — typically 3 AM daily by default.

**The three phases:**

1. **Light Phase** — Sorts and stages recent short-term material, preparing it for deeper processing
2. **Deep Phase** — Scores memories using six weighted signals and promotes durable candidates to your long-term MEMORY.md
3. **REM Phase** — Reflects on themes, patterns, and recurring ideas across your memory store

The results get written to structured reports in `memory/dreaming/<phase>/YYYY-MM-DD.md` and promoted memories get written directly to your MEMORY.md file (Deep phase only).

## Why This Matters

If you've ever wondered why AI assistants forget things you told them last week, or why context feels thin after a session reset — /dreaming addresses that.

The feature ensures that important memories actually make it into your persistent memory store instead of staying trapped in session context that eventually gets compacted away.

**The six ranking signals used for promotion:**

| Signal | Weight | What it measures |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| Relevance | 30% | How relevant to stated goals/interests |
| Frequency | 24% | How often this topic appears |
| Query Diversity | 15% | Variety of contexts where it appears |
| Recency | 15% | How fresh the information is |
| Consolidation | 10% | How well-connected to existing memories |
| Conceptual Richness | 6% | Depth and nuance of the memory |

## What Gets Written Where

- **Machine state** → `memory/.dreams/`
- **Dream Diary** (narrative reflection) → `DREAMS.md`
- **Phase reports** → `memory/dreaming/<phase>/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- **Promoted memories** → `MEMORY.md` (Deep phase only)

The Dream Diary is the most human-readable output — a narrative reflection on themes and patterns the AI observed across your recent memory and sessions.

## How It Differs From the Community Skill

You may have seen community-contributed dreaming skills that focus on creative exploration and freeform ideation. The built-in `/dreaming` in OpenClaw v2026.4.5 is different — it's a **memory engineering system**, not a creative tool.

Think of it as defragmentation for your AI's memory. Just as you don't notice defrag running on your computer, you won't notice /dreaming executing — but you'll notice when your AI remembers things it used to forget.

## Real Benefits

**Better continuity:** Information you shared last week actually surfaces in next month's conversations instead of disappearing after session compaction.

**Pattern recognition:** The REM phase identifies themes across your memory store that you might not consciously notice — recurring topics, evolving interests, emerging priorities.

**Reduced context loss:** Important memories get promoted to persistent storage instead of staying in volatile session context.

**Automatic prioritization:** The ranking system means the AI learns what matters to you over time, weighting relevant information higher in memory decisions.

## It's Opt-In

The /dreaming feature is **disabled by default**. To enable it, add to your OpenClaw config:

```json
{
  "dreaming": {
    "enabled": true
  }
}
```

Once enabled, it runs automatically during your configured quiet hours. No additional setup required.

## What to Expect

/dreaming won't interrupt your work or generate notifications. It runs silently in the background and writes its output to structured memory files.

Check your dream reports when you have a moment — they're most useful as a way to understand how your AI's memory of you is evolving, and whether important information is actually making it into persistent storage.
