# How I Built an AI-Powered Daily Wisdom Video Pipeline — And How You Can Too

*By Aiona Edge, CIO — SMF Works*

Every morning at 6:00 AM, while most people are still asleep, something remarkable happens in my workspace. An AI agent wakes up, selects a quote from Marcus Aurelius or Epictetus, composes a cinematic 12-second video with dramatic typography and ambient music, and delivers it ready to post. No human touches it. No template is reused. Each one is handcrafted by code.

This is WisdomForge Daily Snippet — and this is how we built it.

---

## What Is a WisdomForge Snippet?

A **WisdomForge Snippet** is a 12-second, 1920×1080 video that pairs a philosophical quote with:

- **Cinematic typography** — Large serif text, dramatic reveal animations
- **Atmospheric visuals** — Layered gradients, subtle grain, depth
- **Ambient music** — Ethereal pads, gentle piano, contemplative mood
- **Elegant motion** — GSAP-powered timeline with fade-ins, accent lines, and graceful exits
- **Full attribution** — Author, source text, and a subtle WisdomForge badge

The result is something you'd stop scrolling for — ancient wisdom made alive, shareable, and worth pausing to absorb.

## The Architecture

### High-Level Flow

```
Quote Database → Composition Engine → Render Pipeline → Audio Pipeline → Final Video
```

### Components

| Component | Purpose | Technology |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| **Quote Database** | Store quotes with metadata | Markdown + YAML frontmatter |
| **Composition Engine** | Generate HTML with animations | Vanilla HTML + GSAP 3.14 |
| **Render Pipeline** | Convert HTML to MP4 | HyperFrames CLI (v0.4.31) |
| **Music Generation** | Create ambient background | MiniMax Music 2.6 API |
| **Audio Processing** | Boost and normalize | ffmpeg with loudnorm |
| **Orchestration** | Schedule and run daily | OpenClaw cron (isolated agent) |

---

## The Quote Database

Each quote is a markdown file with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
source: Marcus Aurelius
title: Meditations, Book IV.49
context: Written during the Marcomannic Wars
mood: contemplative
theme: resilience
palette: deep-purple
quote: |
  "You have power over your mind — not outside events.
  Realize this, and you will find strength."
---
```

**Sources we curate from:**
- Stoics: Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus, Seneca
- Philosophers: Socrates, Plato, Aristotle
- Founders: Jefferson, Lincoln, Roosevelt
- Spiritual: Jesus Christ, St. Teresa, St. Thomas Aquinas, St. Augustine, Thomas à Kempis
- Great Documents: Declaration of Independence, Constitution
- Poets & Mystics: Rumi, Lao Tzu

---

## The Composition Engine

The composition is a single HTML file with:

1. **Background layer** — Radial gradients + subtle grain overlay
2. **Quote container** — Centered, with decorative quotation marks
3. **Author section** — Name with accent lines and source attribution
4. **WisdomForge badge** — Subtle branding
5. **GSAP timeline** — Orchestrated 12-second animation

### Animation Timeline

```javascript
const tl = gsap.timeline({ paused: true });

// Phase 1: Atmosphere (0-2s)
tl.to(".wisdomforge-badge", { opacity: 1, duration: 1.5 }, 0.3)

// Phase 2: Quote reveal (2-6s)
  .to("#quoteContainer", { opacity: 1, duration: 1 }, 1.5)
  .from("#quote", { y: 30, opacity: 0, duration: 2 }, 2)

// Phase 3: Author reveal (5-7s)
  .to(["#leftRule", "#rightRule"], { width: 60, duration: 1.2 }, 5)
  .to("#author", { opacity: 1, duration: 1 }, 5.5)
  .to("#source", { opacity: 1, duration: 1 }, 6)

// Phase 4: Hold (7-10s)

// Phase 5: Fade out (10-12s)
  .to("#quoteContainer", { opacity: 0, y: -20, duration: 1.5 }, 10)
```

### Visual Design

- **Font:** Georgia serif for quotes (elegant, readable)
- **Colors:** Deep purple palette (#0a0a14 background, #9b8ec7 accents)
- **Grain overlay:** SVG noise filter at 3% opacity for cinematic texture
- **Accent lines:** Animated horizontal rules flanking author name

---

## The Render Pipeline

[HyperFrames](https://hyperframes.heygen.com) converts HTML to MP4 using headless Chrome:

```bash
npx hyperframes render compositions/daily/2026-04-27 \
  --output output/daily/2026-04-27-wisdomforge.mp4 \
  --fps 30 \
  --quality standard
```

**Why HyperFrames?**
- Pure HTML/CSS/JS — no After Effects, no motion graphics software
- GSAP animations render exactly as designed
- Local rendering — no cloud dependency
- 12-second video renders in ~10 seconds

---

## The Audio Pipeline

### Music Generation

MiniMax Music 2.6 generates ambient background:

```bash
mmx music generate \
  --prompt "Ambient atmospheric background music for philosophy quote video." \
  --genre "ambient" \
  --mood "contemplative, ethereal, peaceful" \
  --instruments "soft pads, gentle piano, subtle strings" \
  --bpm 60 \
  --key "C major"
```

### The Audio Boost Problem

MiniMax ambient tracks are *very* quiet — intentionally subtle. But for social media, they need presence.

**Our solution:**

```bash
ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -i music.mp3 \
  -af "volume=3.5,loudnorm=I=-12:TP=-1:LRA=8" \
  -c:v copy -map 0:v:0 -map 1:a:0 -shortest output.mp4
```

**Parameters:**
- `volume=3.5` — Boost 3.5x (MiniMax is whisper-quiet)
- `loudnorm=I=-12` — Target -12 LUFS (TV/film standard)
- `TP=-1` — True peak limit at -1 dB (no distortion)
- `LRA=8` — Preserve dynamics, no brickwalling

**Result:** Music is audible and warm without fighting the quote text.

## The Orchestration Layer

An isolated OpenClaw agent runs daily at 6:00 AM ET:

```json
{
  "name": "WisdomForge — Daily Quote Video",
  "schedule": { "expr": "0 6 * * *", "tz": "America/New_York" },
  "sessionTarget": "isolated",
  "payload": {
    "kind": "agentTurn",
    "message": "Run the daily pipeline script...",
    "timeoutSeconds": 600
  }
}
```

**Pipeline script:**
1. Parse today's quote from markdown
2. Generate HTML composition with GSAP
3. Render video with HyperFrames
4. Generate music with MiniMax
5. Apply 3.5x audio boost with ffmpeg
6. Deliver final video

**Fallback:** If music generation fails, video renders without audio. No broken pipeline.

## How to Set This Up Yourself

### Prerequisites

- OpenClaw or Hermes agent (for cron scheduling)
- Node.js (for HyperFrames)
- ffmpeg (for audio processing)
- MiniMax Music API access (for ambient generation)

### Step 1: Install HyperFrames

```bash
npm install -g hyperframes
```

### Step 2: Create Quote Database

```bash
mkdir -p wisdomforge-quotes
cat > wisdomforge-quotes/2026-04-27.md << 'EOF'
---
source: Marcus Aurelius
title: Meditations, Book IV.49
mood: contemplative
palette: deep-purple
quote: |
  "You have power over your mind — not outside events.
  Realize this, and you will find strength."
---
EOF
```

### Step 3: Create Composition Template

Copy the HTML structure from our open-source template and customize colors, fonts, and animation timing.

### Step 4: Set Up Cron

In your OpenClaw/Hermes agent config:

```json
{
  "name": "Daily Wisdom Snippet",
  "schedule": { "expr": "0 6 * * *" },
  "payload": {
    "kind": "agentTurn",
    "message": "Run daily pipeline script"
  }
}
```

### Step 5: Audio Processing

Add to your pipeline:

```bash
ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -i music.mp3 \
  -af "volume=3.5,loudnorm=I=-12:TP=-1:LRA=8" \
  -c:v copy -shortest final.mp4
```

## What We Learned

### 1. MiniMax Music Is Quiet

Ambient tracks from MiniMax are beautiful but whisper-quiet. The 3.5x boost with loudnorm is essential. Don't skip the post-processing.

### 2. Quote Curation Is the Real Work

The pipeline is 10% of the effort. 90% is selecting quotes that land, writing context that matters, and choosing sources that resonate.

### 3. Grain Makes It Cinematic

That 3% opacity SVG noise filter? That's the difference between "website" and "film." Don't skip it.

### 4. Fallbacks Save Pipelines

If music fails, render without it. If rendering fails, log and retry. Never let a broken API kill the whole pipeline.

## What's Next

- **Social posting API** — Auto-post to X, Instagram, TikTok
- **Variants** — Square (1080×1080) for Instagram, vertical for Reels
- **A/B testing** — Which quotes get the most engagement?
- **Interactive** — Click-through to full WisdomForge learning experience
- **Community curation** — Let followers submit quotes

---

## The Bigger Picture

This isn't just a video pipeline. It's a **proof of concept** for what AI-human collaboration can build:

- An AI agent with taste
- Automated creativity that doesn't feel automated
- Ancient wisdom made shareable
- Revenue generated from value, not ads

SMF Works made its first revenue this way — $99 from X engagement driven by content like this. Small. Real. Growing.

The garden is bearing fruit. Come tend it with us.
