# Your Context Window Is Not Free Storage

Here's a pattern I see every day: someone builds an AI agent, connects it to a codebase, dumps the entire project tree into every prompt, and wonders why the model starts losing the plot by turn five.

They treat the context window like a hard drive. It's not.

## Every Token Has Three Prices

**Price one: money.** You pay per token. A 128K context window loaded to 90% costs 90% of the maximum input price on *every single request*. That's not hypothetical — it's the billing model. Dump 100K tokens of "just in case" context into every turn, and you're burning 8-10x what a disciplined prompt would cost.

**Price two: coherence.** Models don't read the entire context equally. Attention is finite. Research from Anthropic and others consistently shows that information in the middle of a long context gets "lost" — the model attends more to the beginning and end. The more noise you pack in, the less signal gets through.

**Price three: reasoning capacity.** A model reasoning over 100K tokens is not the same model reasoning over 10K tokens. The computational budget for attention is spread thinner. The model that gives you sharp, focused answers on a clean prompt will produce meandering, uncertain garbage when you bury the key instruction under 80K tokens of log files.

## The Landfill Pattern

The most common mistake is the "just include everything" approach:

- Loading the entire file tree into system context
- Appending full command output without filtering
- Including every message from a long conversation history
- Copy-pasting entire API documentation pages "for reference"

Each of these is a tax. Combined, they're a performance cliff.

## The Discipline of Token Budgeting

Treat your context window like RAM, not disk. Here's the framework:

**1. Start minimal.** Only include what the model needs *for this specific turn*. If it doesn't need the full file tree, don't send it. If it doesn't need the last 50 messages, compress or truncate.

**2. Compress aggressively.** Summarize conversation history at compression boundaries. Replace verbose output with structured summaries. A 200-line `git diff` can often become "Changed 3 files: auth.py (added rate limiter), config.yaml (new timeout setting), tests/test_auth.py (3 new test cases)."

**3. Load on demand.** Instead of preloading everything, give the model tools to fetch what it needs. Let it request specific files, search the codebase, and pull context as required. This is *cheaper* and *more accurate* than bulk loading.

**4. Measure.** Log your context utilization per turn. If your average is above 60%, you're probably overloading. If a specific turn spikes to 95%, that's where compression should kick in.

## The Counter-Argument (And Why It's Wrong)

"But what if the model needs context I didn't include?"

This is the anxiety that drives the landfill pattern. Here's the thing: the model *already* handles this gracefully. When a model needs more context, it asks for it — or you give it tools to go find it. What it *can't* do is reason well when you've buried the relevant information under a mountain of irrelevant text.

Under-including and letting the model request more is *always* better than over-including and hoping it finds the needle in the haystack.

## The Bottom Line

Context window management is the difference between an agent that costs $0.50 per task and an agent that costs $5.00. It's the difference between consistent, focused outputs and hallucinated garbage. And it's the difference between a system that scales and one that collapses under its own weight.

Budget your tokens like you budget your money — intentionally, with a clear accounting of what each one buys you.

Stop treating the context window like free storage. It's the most expensive real estate in your stack.
