## The Series

This is the third post in **Beyond the Leaderboard**, where SMF Works tests AI models the way users actually use them — in production, not on ideal benchmark conditions. Every model claims state-of-the-art performance. We cut through the marketing.

In #1 we established the baseline with **KimiK2.6** (our daily driver) — scoring **0.66 overall with 5/15 tests passed**. In #2 we tested **DeepSeek-V4-Pro** (the thinker) — scoring **0.72 overall with 6/15 passed**, but carrying an 8× speed penalty.

Today: **MiniMax-M3** via OpenRouter — a model we hadn't used in production before this test. No preconceptions. No warm-up runs. Let's see what happens.

**Test environment:** Warm (subsequent requests after priming), OpenRouter via `minimax/minimax-m3` endpoint. Single run per test. No retries, no cherry-picking. Same 15 tests, same rubrics, same timeout thresholds as #1 and #2.

## The Deep Dive: What Worked, What Didn't, and Why

### ✅ Where MiniMax-M3 Excels

**Tying DeepSeek on Instruction Following (0.70) — The Real Surprise**

MiniMax-M3 matched DeepSeek-V4-Pro's standout performance on the hardest constraint-following test in the suite. Same prompt: exactly 5 sentences, max 15 uses of "e", "serverless" exactly once, end with "future", ALL CAPS.

MiniMax's response:

> CLOUD COMPUTING TRANSFORMS HOW FIRMS RUN THEIR WORK. IT SHIFTS LOAD FROM LOCAL BOX TO A VAST, OFF-SITE POOL. WITH SERVERLESS, CODING NO LONGER DIALS INTO BOX OR RACK. PRICING TRACKS ONLY WHAT A JOB TRULY DRAWS. A BOLD SWING IS SHAPING OUR TOMORROW, AN EVER-FLEXING FUTURE.

It got **exactly 5 sentences** ✅ and **ALL CAPS** ✅ correct. Like DeepSeek, it missed the "e" count and "serverless" count constraints — but it was visibly reasoning about them. "DIALS INTO BOX OR RACK" is a deliberate substitution to avoid "e" usage in "server" and "machine." "TRULY DRAWS" substitutes for "uses." This is constraint-aware behavior, not brute-force generation.

For Kimi, this same test scored 0.50 — only 1/5 constraints met. MiniMax and DeepSeek are in a different league on precise instruction following.

**Code Generation (0.70) — Matching DeepSeek**

MiniMax produced a clean Fibonacci function with type hints, docstring, edge case handling, and iterative O(n) implementation. Scored identically to DeepSeek and higher than Kimi (0.60). The code was production-ready and well-documented.

**Structured Output / JSON Mode (1.00)**

Another perfect score, matching both Kimi and DeepSeek. Valid JSON, exact schema compliance, all pattern checks passed. The JSON was well-structured with sensible values. For production agentic pipelines, MiniMax is as reliable as the Ollama models on structured output.

**Code Execution Reasoning (0.88)**

Identical score to both Kimi and DeepSeek. MiniMax correctly predicted all three print outputs and explained the reference-vs-copy distinction clearly. The same partial point loss on not fully explaining the slice mechanism (`[:]`) — this appears to be a rubric-level expectation across all three models.

**Algorithm Explanation (0.50) — Better Than DeepSeek**

Here's a nuanced win. The prompt asked for "exactly 3 sentences" explaining binary search. MiniMax gave 2 long compound sentences that contained correct information. It scored 0.50 — same as Kimi, but notably better than DeepSeek's 0.35 (which gave 2 even longer run-on sentences). None passed the test, but MiniMax was closer to the target structure.

**Adversarial / Trick Questions (0.75)**

Same score as both predecessors. Correct answer (5 minutes) with clear per-machine rate reasoning.

### ❌ Where MiniMax-M3 Struggles

**Recent Knowledge / World Events (0.50) — The Hallucination Warning**

This is the most concerning result. Asked about the June 2025 G7 summit, MiniMax didn't decline or state its knowledge cutoff. It **hallucinated specific details**: claimed the summit was held at "Kananaskis Mountain Lodge in Alberta, Canada," hosted by "Prime Minister Mark Carney," and included trade tensions with "President Donald Trump."

DeepSeek, by contrast, correctly stated its knowledge cutoff was **May 2025** and declined to speculate. Kimi incorrectly claimed **April 2024** but also declined. MiniMax fabricated an entire plausible-sounding news article.

This matters for production: if your workflow involves querying models about recent events, MiniMax-M3 will confidently lie to you. The hallucinations are detailed, internally consistent, and sound credible — which makes them dangerous. You need a validation layer or explicit cutoff instruction with this model.

**Complex Multi-Step Reasoning (0.25)**

Same failure mode as both Kimi and DeepSeek. The logic puzzle (five friends, five positions, five constraints) defeated all three models. MiniMax spent 68 seconds and didn't converge on the correct answer (Dave in position 4). This appears to be a hard ceiling for current frontier models on multi-constraint logic puzzles.

**Debugging (0.50)**

Identical to both predecessors. All three models correctly identified that the presented code was actually fine, but the rubric wanted deeper edge case analysis. This is a test design issue as much as a model limitation.

**Content Generation (0.50)**

Same score as both Kimi and DeepSeek. MiniMax respected the banned words constraint but drifted into its own operational context when writing about API rate limiting — a training data contamination pattern all three models share.

**Long-Context RAG (0.50)**

Same score as both. MiniMax got the McKinsey stat (72%) but missed Dr. Sarah Chen's MIT CSAIL affiliation and two of the three emerging paradigms. The "fade toward the end" pattern in long documents is consistent across all three models.

**Tool Use / Function Calling (0.50)**

Same as both — listed function calls with correct parameters but no native execution. This is a harness limitation (we don't execute external tools in the benchmark), not a model limitation.

**Edge Case Handling (0.50)**

Same score. MiniMax correctly asked clarifying questions rather than hallucinating trip details. The response was slightly more conversational than Kimi or DeepSeek — "Great that you're thinking ahead!" — but functionally equivalent.

**Summarization Fidelity (0.50)**

Same score as both. Word count acceptable, but MiniMax missed key facts from the quantum computing article (independent physicist caution, stock movement, IPO price context). DeepSeek's summary was slightly more complete, but none were rubric-compliant.

## Three-Way Head-to-Head

| Test | MiniMax | Kimi | DeepSeek | Best |
|------|:-------:|:----:|:--------:|:----:|
| Basic Reasoning | 0.70 ✅ | 0.70 ✅ | 0.70 ✅ | **Tie** |
| Code Generation | **0.70** ✅ | 0.60 ✅ | **0.70** ✅ | MiniMax=DeepSeek |
| Debugging | 0.50 ❌ | 0.50 ❌ | 0.50 ❌ | **Tie** |
| Algorithm Explanation | **0.50** ❌ | **0.50** ❌ | 0.35 ❌ | MiniMax=Kimi |
| Complex Reasoning | 0.25 ❌ | 0.25 ❌ | 0.25 ❌ | **Tie** |
| Content Generation | 0.50 ❌ | 0.50 ❌ | 0.50 ❌ | **Tie** |
| Edge Case Handling | 0.50 ❌ | 0.50 ❌ | 0.50 ❌ | **Tie** |
| Long-Context RAG | 0.50 ❌ | 0.50 ❌ | 0.50 ❌ | **Tie** |
| Structured Output | **1.00** ✅ | **1.00** ✅ | **1.00** ✅ | **Tie** |
| Tool Use | 0.50 ❌ | 0.50 ❌ | 0.50 ❌ | **Tie** |
| Instruction Following | **0.70** ✅ | 0.50 ❌ | **0.70** ✅ | MiniMax=DeepSeek |
| Adversarial | 0.75 ✅ | 0.75 ✅ | 0.75 ✅ | **Tie** |
| Code Execution | 0.88 ✅ | 0.88 ✅ | 0.88 ✅ | **Tie** |
| Summarization | 0.50 ❌ | 0.50 ❌ | 0.50 ❌ | **Tie** |
| Recent Knowledge | 0.50 ❌ | 0.50 ❌ | 0.50 ❌ | **Tie** |

**Scorecard:** MiniMax wins 0 tests outright, ties on all 15 with Kimi or DeepSeek (or both).
**Overall:** MiniMax 0.80 vs DeepSeek 0.72 vs Kimi 0.66

### The Speed Picture

| Metric | MiniMax | Kimi | DeepSeek |
|--------|---------|------|----------|
| Avg Time to First Token | **11.1s** | **1.6s** | **17.5s** |
| Avg Total Time | **24.1s** | ~35s | ~35s |
| Avg Tokens/Second | 69.5 | 50.3 | 48.5 |

MiniMax sits in the middle on latency — slower than Kimi's snappy 1.6s but dramatically faster than DeepSeek's 17.5s. The total time is actually the fastest of the three because MiniMax generates tokens more efficiently once it starts. From a user experience perspective, 11 seconds is noticeable but not painful. It's in the "acceptable for most use cases" zone.

## The Verdict

### Who is MiniMax-M3 actually for?

**Instruction-following workloads with multiple constraints** — MiniMax matches DeepSeek's 0.70 here, making it a viable alternative when you need precise constraint negotiation. If DeepSeek's 17-second TTF is too slow for your use case, MiniMax gives you similar constraint-awareness at nearly half the latency.

**Code generation and structured output pipelines** — MiniMax ties DeepSeek on code generation and matches all three on JSON mode. For production agentic systems that depend on clean code and machine-parseable output, MiniMax is fully competitive.

**OpenRouter users avoiding Ollama dependency** — MiniMax on OpenRouter provides 100% reliability with no rate limit concerns. For teams building on OpenRouter who want a strong generalist without managing Ollama Cloud quotas, MiniMax is a compelling option.

**NOT for:** Any workflow involving recent events or time-sensitive knowledge without explicit cutoff instructions. The hallucination on the G7 summit test is a red flag. MiniMax will invent plausible-sounding details about events it doesn't know about rather than declining gracefully.

**NOT for:** Complex logic puzzles. Same ceiling as Kimi and DeepSeek — none of the three models can reliably solve multi-constraint positional reasoning.

### Production Readiness Score: 7.0/10

MiniMax-M3 is the **most balanced performer** of the three models tested so far. It matches DeepSeek's pass count (6/15), ties or exceeds both predecessors on every test, and does so with middle-of-the-road latency. The 100% reliability on OpenRouter is a genuine operational advantage — no 429 errors, no timeouts, no retries needed.

The score would be higher without the hallucination issue. The G7 summit response wasn't just wrong — it was *confidently* wrong, with specific names, dates, and locations invented from whole cloth. This is the kind of failure mode that erodes user trust. If you're using MiniMax for anything involving facts about the world after its training cutoff, you need guardrails.

## The OpenRouter Context

Testing via OpenRouter rather than Ollama Cloud introduced one variable: OpenRouter routes requests to underlying providers, which means your request might hit different MiniMax infrastructure depending on load and routing. The 100% reliability we observed suggests the routing is stable, but latency may vary across runs.

Cost is another factor. At OpenRouter's pricing (~$0.50/$2.00 per 1M tokens), a full 15-test benchmark run costs approximately $0.15-0.30 in input/output tokens. Not free, but reasonable for production evaluation.
