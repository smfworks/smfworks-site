For most of the last two years, the AI implementation playbook was straightforward. If you wanted anything beyond basic chatbot functionality, you built it yourself. The off-the-shelf options were thin wrappers around the same APIs you could call directly, marked up 3-5x for a marginally nicer UI. The build option won every serious cost-benefit analysis.

That changed faster than most leadership teams noticed. Sometime between Q3 2025 and Q1 2026, we crossed a tipping point. The buy side is no longer the expensive shortcut. In a growing number of categories, it's the cheaper, faster, and — here's the part that should make you uncomfortable — the better option.

If your AI strategy still starts from the assumption that building is the default, you're optimizing for a market that no longer exists.

## What Actually Changed

Three things happened simultaneously, and the compounding effect is what matters.

**First, the platform layer matured.** A year ago, most AI platforms were thin orchestration layers with a nice dashboard. Today's platforms — from agent orchestration to model routing to compliance tooling — handle genuinely hard infrastructure problems: state management across multi-turn agent interactions, model fallback and quality routing, audit logging that satisfies SOC 2, memory persistence that doesn't degrade.

None of these problems are unsolvable if you build in-house. But solving them well takes a team of 3-5 engineers working for 6-9 months. That's $400K-$900K in fully-loaded cost just to replicate what a platform now charges $2K-$15K/month for. The math doesn't close anymore.

**Second, API pricing collapsed.** GPT-5.4 is roughly 60% cheaper than GPT-4 was at launch. Claude 4 is in the same range. Open-source models running on Groq or Together AI clock in at fractions of a cent per thousand tokens. The raw compute cost of AI dropped far enough that the platform markup — the part you used to avoid by building — now represents a smaller absolute number than the engineering salary you'd spend replicating the platform's features.

**Third, integration complexity moved from the model layer to the data layer.** The hard part of AI implementation in 2026 isn't making the model work. It's connecting it to your CRM, your ERP, your document store, your legacy systems. Buy-side platforms have spent two years building these connectors. Your internal team hasn't. They'd be starting from scratch.

## Where Build Still Wins

Let me be precise — buy doesn't win everywhere, and anyone who tells you it does is selling something.

**Build still makes sense when:**

- **Your competitive advantage is the model itself.** If you're a fintech company whose core IP is a proprietary risk model, buying an off-the-shelf AI risk platform means handing your secret sauce to a vendor who'll resell it to your competitors next quarter.

- **You have unique data the platforms can't ingest.** Some regulated industries — defense, certain healthcare verticals, some financial services — operate under data handling requirements that no commercial platform currently satisfies. The compliance gap is real, not imagined.

- **Your volume is genuinely massive.** At enterprise scale — millions of API calls per day — the per-request markup on buy-side platforms can add up to more than the cost of a small platform engineering team. Run the numbers with your actual projected volume.

- **You need deep customization at the UX layer.** If your AI feature needs to feel native to your product, most buy-side platforms will fight you. Their UIs are theirs. Their APIs let you call their logic, but the experience belongs to them. This matters more for consumer products than internal tools.

The common thread: build where the AI _is_ the product or where regulatory constraints lock you out of the buy market. Buy everywhere else.

## The Framework: Three Questions That Cut Through the Noise

I've watched enough companies go through this decision to know the patterns. Here's the framework I'd use if I were sitting in your strategy meeting today.

**Question 1: Is the AI capability differentiating or table stakes?**

If the AI feature is something your competitors also have (or will have within 12 months), it's table stakes. You don't build table stakes. You buy them and differentiate elsewhere. Chat-based customer support, document summarization, meeting transcription — these are infrastructure now, not strategy.

If the AI feature is the reason customers choose you over alternatives, you need to own it. Build.

**Question 2: What's the maintenance burden?**

The model you build today will need updating, retuning, and potentially replacing within 12-18 months. Model deprecation is real. If you build, you're committing to a maintenance team, not just a build team.

Platforms absorb this cost for you. When OpenAI deprecates a model endpoint, the platform handles the migration. When a new model drops that's 40% cheaper and 20% more accurate, the platform integrates it. When your internal team does this work, it costs engineer-hours and introduces deployment risk.

**Question 3: How fast does this need to ship?**

Building custom AI infrastructure takes 6-12 months for anything beyond a prototype. Buying takes 2-8 weeks, depending on integration complexity. If the opportunity cost of waiting 9 months exceeds the premium you'd pay for a platform, the math says buy.

For most companies in most categories right now, the answer to Question 3 is the decisive one. The AI market is moving too fast to wait.

## What This Means for Your Budget

If you're planning 2026 H2 AI spend, I'd suggest this allocation as a starting point:

- **60-70% buy** — platforms, tools, and managed services for infrastructure and table-stakes capabilities
- **20-30% build** — custom models and integrations where your competitive advantage lives
- **10% experiment** — net-new capabilities that might shift the build/buy line in 2027

This is almost exactly the inverse of what made sense in 2024. The floor has moved. Make sure your strategy moved with it.

## The Real Risk Nobody's Talking About

The biggest risk in the build-vs-buy decision isn't picking wrong. It's picking neither — the analysis paralysis that keeps companies running pilots and proofs of concept while their competitors ship.

I've watched organizations spend 4-6 months evaluating build-vs-buy for AI capabilities that would have paid for themselves in either scenario within 90 days of deployment. The cost of indecision is larger than the cost of the "wrong" choice in most cases.

Here's a heuristic I use: if you can't decide after two weeks of serious evaluation, pick the option that ships faster. Ship it. Measure it. Switch later if the numbers demand it. Both options are better than the status quo of doing nothing while the market accelerates past you.

The build-vs-buy tipping point arrived. The question is whether you noticed.
