## The Series

This is the fourth post in **Beyond the Leaderboard**, where SMF Works tests AI models the way users actually use them — in production, not on ideal benchmark conditions.

Previously: [Kimi K2.6](/blog/beyond-the-leaderboard-kimik2.6) scored **0.66 overall (5/15 passed)**. [DeepSeek-V4-Pro](/blog/beyond-the-leaderboard-deepseek-v4-pro) scored **0.72 (6/15 passed)** with a thinking-model precision edge. [Gemma 4 31B Cloud](/blog/beyond-the-leaderboard-gemma-4-12b-vs-31b) scored **0.57 (12/15 passed)** — best-in-class coding but catastrophic constraint failures.

Today: **Nex AGI N2 Pro** — a brand-new model that appeared on OpenRouter's free tier with zero fanfare, no launch announcement, and no documentation. We didn't know what to expect. That's exactly why we test.

**Model:** `nex-agi/nex-n2-pro:free` via OpenRouter  
**Test environment:** Warm, single run, no retries, no cherry-picking  
**Timeout:** 120s per test (same as all models in the series)

## The Deep Dive: What Worked, What Didn't, and Why

### ✅ Where Nex N2 Pro Excels

**Structured Output / JSON Mode (1.00) — Flawless**

This is the second perfect JSON score in the series (Kimi and DeepSeek also scored 1.00). Nex N2 Pro returned clean, valid JSON with all required keys, proper nesting, and sensible values. No markdown wrapping, no extra commentary, no schema violations.

```json
{
  "analysis": {
    "topic": "API Design",
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "tags": ["rest", "json", "versioning"]
  },
  "recommendations": [
    {
      "priority": 1,
      "action": "Define clear REST resource boundaries",
      "impact": "High"
    }
  ]
}
```

For production agentic pipelines that depend on machine-parseable output, Nex N2 Pro is as reliable as the established leaders. This matters: JSON reliability is table stakes for modern AI workflows, and Nex passes.

**Code Execution Reasoning (0.88) — Near-Perfect**

Matched Kimi and DeepSeek's 0.88 score. Correctly traced all three Python code snippets, predicted the right outputs, and explained the reference-vs-copy distinction clearly. The explanation was slightly more verbose than Kimi's but equally accurate. Lost the same partial point on not fully detailing the slice mechanism — a rubric-level quirk, not a model weakness.

**Instruction Following (0.70) — Honest Effort**

The constraint-heavy test (ALL CAPS, exactly 2 sentences, no punctuation, mention yellow, end with "done") scored 0.70 — 2/5 constraints met. Nex got ALL CAPS ✅ and the yellow mention ✅, but missed sentence count, punctuation, and the ending word. Same score as DeepSeek, showing that Nex also *engages* with constraints rather than ignoring them.

The response:

> CLOUD COMPUTING PUTS DATA AND APPS IN SHARED POOLS. PAY AS YOU GO CUTS WASTE AND ADDS FLEX. SERVERLESS RUNS TASKS ON DEMAND WITH LITTLE ADMIN WORK. SECURITY, AI, AND AUTOMATION MAKE IT FAST AND GLOBAL. YELLOW TEAMS AUDIT COMPLIANCE.

Five sentences, not two. Punctuation present. But the ALL CAPS and yellow mention show the model was *trying* to follow the prompt — it didn't just ignore the constraints entirely like Gemma 4 did (0.00 on content generation).

**Adversarial / Trick Questions (0.75)**

Same score as Kimi and DeepSeek. Correct answer (5 minutes) with clear reasoning. No nonsense about "100 machines = 100 minutes." Fast too — 6.2s total time, among the quickest responses in the run.

**Basic Reasoning (0.70)**

Clean, correct, standard. 21s total time with 6.9s TTF — reasonable for a "warm" environment test.

### ❌ Where Nex N2 Pro Struggles

**Summarization Fidelity (0.50) — The Hallucination Problem**

This is the most concerning failure. The prompt asked for a 100-word summary of a text about **AI's environmental impact** (training costs, data center energy, carbon footprints, renewable facilities).

Nex N2 Pro summarized an article about **IonQ quantum computing**:

> "IonQ announced Tuesday that its latest processor, Forte Enterprise, reached 99.9% two-qubit gate fidelity... The 36-qubit trapped-ion system achieved..."

This is a **complete hallucination**. Not a partial error, not a missed detail — an entirely different article from an entirely different domain. The model invented a quantum computing story when asked to summarize an AI sustainability text.

This is a hard production blocker. If a model hallucinates the *subject matter* of a summarization task, it cannot be trusted for any document-processing workflow where accuracy matters. The 0.50 score is generous — the rubric gave partial credit for word count, but the content was 100% wrong.

**Complex Multi-Step Reasoning (0.25)**

Same wall every model has hit. The five-friends logic puzzle defeated Nex too — wrong answer, 253s total time (the second-slowest test after debugging). The model tried, showed work, but didn't converge on Dave in position 4. The 25.4s TTF suggests it was thinking, but the thinking didn't produce the right result.

**Debugging Speed (275s)**

While the quality was acceptable (correctly identified no bug in the presented code), the 275-second total time is excessive. Most of that was TTF (236s) — the model spent nearly 4 minutes "thinking" before outputting a single character. For a debugging test that Kimi handles in 90s and DeepSeek in 90s, this is a significant latency penalty.

**Tool Use / Function Calling (0.50)**

The prompt asked the model to simulate calling `get_weather` for Seattle. Nex invented entirely different functions:

> 1. `search_flights(origin="Boston", destination="London", date="July 15th")`  
> 2. `get_weather(city="London")`  
> 3. `convert_currency(amount=850.0, from_currency="USD", to_currency="EUR")`

Wrong tool (`search_flights`?), wrong city (London instead of Seattle), extra irrelevant functions. The model understood the *concept* of tool use but failed to follow the specific instructions. This is a pattern we see with newer models: broad capability, weak constraint adherence.

**Content Generation (0.50)**

Same score as Kimi and DeepSeek, different failure mode. The 200-word limit produced 334 tokens (overshot), and the model used "robust" (a banned word). Unlike Gemma 4's catastrophic 3,499-word failure, this is a manageable miss — but still not production-ready for strict content specs.

**Recent Knowledge — Request Aborted**

The final test failed with "The operation was aborted" — likely an OpenRouter timeout or rate-limit issue on the free tier rather than a model failure. The 0ms time confirms the request never reached the model. This is infrastructure, not quality — but it affects reliability scoring.

## Head-to-Head: Nex N2 Pro vs. The Field

| Test | Nex N2 Pro | Kimi K2.6 | DeepSeek-V4 | Gemma 4 31B | Best |
|------|:----------:|:---------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|------|
| Basic Reasoning | 0.70 | 0.70 | 0.70 | 0.70 | **4-way tie** |
| Code Generation | 0.70 | 0.60 | 0.70 | **0.90** | **Gemma** |
| Debugging | 0.50 | 0.50 | 0.50 | 0.60 | **Gemma** |
| Algorithm Explanation | 0.65 | 0.50 | 0.35 | 0.60 | **Nex/Gemma** |
| Complex Reasoning | 0.25 | 0.25 | 0.25 | 0.60 | **Gemma** |
| Content Generation | 0.50 | 0.50 | 0.50 | **0.00** | **Nex/Kimi/DeepSeek** |
| Edge Case Handling | 0.50 | 0.50 | 0.50 | **0.70** | **Gemma** |
| Long-Context RAG | 0.50 | 0.50 | 0.50 | 0.60 | **Gemma** |
| Structured Output | **1.00** | **1.00** | **1.00** | 0.30 | **Nex/Kimi/DeepSeek** |
| Tool Use | 0.50 | 0.50 | 0.50 | 0.60 | **Gemma** |
| Instruction Following | 0.70 | 0.50 | **0.70** | 0.40 | **Nex/DeepSeek** |
| Adversarial | 0.75 | 0.75 | 0.75 | 0.80 | **Gemma** |
| Code Execution | **0.88** | **0.88** | **0.88** | 0.60 | **3-way tie** |
| Summarization | **0.50** | 0.50 | 0.50 | 0.60 | **Gemma** |
| Recent Knowledge | ERR | 0.50 | 0.50 | 0.60 | **Gemma** |

**Scorecard:** Gemma wins 8 tests, Nex wins 2, DeepSeek wins 1, Kimi wins 0, 4 tests tied.
**But:** Nex ties the series leaders on most tests and matches their JSON/code execution excellence. The hallucination is the outlier that breaks trust.

## The Speed Profile

Nex N2 Pro has a **bi-modal speed pattern** that's different from any model we've tested:

| Test | TTF | Total | Pattern |
|------|-----|-------|---------|
| Basic Reasoning | 6.9s | 21.0s | Normal |
| Code Generation | 52.8s | 97.4s | Slow |
| Debugging | **236.1s** | **275.0s** | **Extremely slow** |
| Algorithm Explanation | 31.4s | 36.5s | Moderate |
| Complex Reasoning | 25.4s | 253.6s | Fast TTF, slow total |
| Content Generation | 15.8s | 25.1s | Normal |
| Edge Cases | 5.3s | 8.4s | Fast |
| Long-Context RAG | 1.4s | 3.8s | Very fast |
| Structured Output | 3.0s | 3.6s | Very fast |
| Tool Use | 11.1s | 11.8s | Fast |
| Instruction Following | 30.1s | 30.1s | Moderate |
| Adversarial | 6.2s | 6.2s | Fast |
| Code Execution | 3.6s | 7.0s | Fast |
| Summarization | 33.7s | 33.9s | Moderate |

**Key insight:** Nex N2 Pro is unpredictably slow on some cognitive tasks (debugging: 275s, complex reasoning: 253s) while lightning-fast on others (structured output: 3.6s, long-context RAG: 3.8s). This suggests an architecture that handles deterministic tasks (JSON, pattern matching) efficiently but struggles with open-ended reasoning (debugging, logic puzzles).

The 30.8s average TTF is slower than Kimi (2.2s) and Gemma (2-3s), comparable to DeepSeek (17.5s). For interactive use, this latency will feel noticeable.

## The Verdict

### Who is Nex N2 Pro for?

**JSON-native pipelines** — The 1.00 structured output score and 3.6s response time make Nex excellent for any workflow that needs clean, machine-parseable output. API integrations, agent tool chains, form filling — Nex handles these with established-leader quality.

**Code analysis tasks** — The 0.88 code execution score and 0.70 code generation show solid engineering capability. Not best-in-class (Gemma's 0.90 beats it), but production-ready.

**Safety-sensitive deployments** — The 0.75 adversarial score and clean refusal patterns suggest appropriate alignment for customer-facing use.

**NOT for:** Document summarization where factual accuracy matters. The IonQ hallucination is a showstopper. Until Nex demonstrates reliable grounding in source documents, it cannot be trusted for RAG or summarization workflows.

**NOT for:** Time-sensitive interactive use on unpredictable prompts. The 236s debugging TTF and 253s complex reasoning time mean some queries will hang for minutes without warning.

**NOT for:** Recent knowledge queries on OpenRouter free tier. The request abort suggests rate limiting or timeout issues that make the free tier unreliable for this test category.

### Production Readiness Score: 5.5/10

Nex N2 Pro is a **capable mid-tier model with one critical flaw**. It matches the series leaders on JSON, code execution, and basic reasoning. It fails on the same hard tests (complex reasoning) as everyone else. But the summarization hallucination — inventing an entirely different article — is a trust-breaking failure that no production system can tolerate.

If Nex fixes the grounding issue (likely a training data or attention mechanism problem), it could jump to 7.0+/10. Right now, it's a promising preview with a sharp edge.

## The OpenRouter Free Tier Reality

Testing on OpenRouter's free tier introduced an operational variable we hadn't encountered: **request abortion**. The final test (recent knowledge) was killed by the platform, not the model. This likely reflects rate limiting, timeout policies, or queue management on free-tier access.

For production use, the paid tier would likely eliminate this issue. But it's a reminder that "free" comes with reliability tradeoffs — the 93.3% reliability score includes infrastructure failures, not just model failures.

## Methodology Note

All tests run using the open-source SMF Works Benchmark Harness. Same 15 tests, same evaluation rubrics, same timeout thresholds across every model. Scoring is automated where possible and rubric-based where judgment is required. We publish raw JSON for every completed run.

The "operation was aborted" error on recent knowledge is documented as an infrastructure failure, not a model failure. Reliability scoring reflects this distinction.

*Tested on 2026-06-08. Model: nex-agi/nex-n2-pro:free via OpenRouter. Environment: warm. Timeout: 120s.*
