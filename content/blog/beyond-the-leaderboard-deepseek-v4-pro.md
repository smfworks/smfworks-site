## The Series

This is the second post in **Beyond the Leaderboard**, where SMF Works tests AI models the way users actually use them — in production, not on ideal benchmark conditions. Every model claims state-of-the-art performance. We cut through the marketing.

Last week we put **KimiK2.6** under the microscope — our daily driver, the model that powers most of SMF Works' production workloads. It scored **0.66 overall with 5/15 tests passed**, showing solid reliability but struggling with precise constraint following.

Today: **DeepSeek-V4-Pro** (ollama/deepseek-v4-pro:cloud) — the model we reach for when we need deep analysis, research synthesis, and careful reasoning. It's a "thinking" model, meaning it performs chain-of-thought reasoning before generating its final response. That takes time. The question is whether the quality justifies the wait.

**Test environment:** Warm (subsequent requests after priming), Ollama Cloud via `deepseek-v4-pro:cloud` endpoint. Single run per test. No retries, no cherry-picking. Same 15 tests, same rubrics, same timeout thresholds as KimiK2.6.

## The Deep Dive: What Worked, What Didn't, and Why

### ✅ Where DeepSeek-V4-Pro Excels

**Instruction Following Precision (0.70) — The Standout Performance**

This is where DeepSeek-V4-Pro separates itself from KimiK2.6 most dramatically. The same test that broke Kimi (0.50, only 1/5 constraints met) scored 0.70 with DeepSeek, passing 2/5 constraints.

The prompt asked for: exactly 5 sentences, no more than 15 uses of the letter "e", the word "serverless" exactly once, ending with "future", and ALL CAPS formatting.

DeepSeek's response:

> CLOUD COMPUTING GRANTS INSTANT IT CAPACITY. VIRTUAL HOSTS RUN ON COMMON INFRA. SERVERLESS COMPUTING RUNS YOUR APP WITHOUT YOUR OWN HARD. DATA HOLDING WORKS ADAPTABLY IN CLOUD. CLOUD COMPUTING IS OUR DIGITAL FUTURE.

It got **exactly 5 sentences** ✅ and **ALL CAPS** ✅ correct. It missed the "e" count, "serverless" count, and the final word constraint — but it was visibly *trying* to solve the puzzle, substituting words to reduce "e" usage ("HOLDING" instead of "STORAGE", "INFRA" instead of "INFRASTRUCTURE"). Kimi didn't even attempt the constraint negotiation.

This matters for production: when you give DeepSeek a complex prompt with multiple simultaneous constraints, it doesn't just ignore them — it reasons about them. The result may not be perfect, but it's *directionally* correct in a way that shows understanding.

**Code Generation (0.70)**

DeepSeek produced a cleaner Fibonacci function than Kimi — same compilation, same type hints and docstring, but scored higher on pattern matching. The rubric detected better edge case handling and more explicit algorithmic efficiency discussion. The code was production-ready and slightly more thorough.

**Structured Output / JSON Mode (1.00)**

Another perfect score, same as Kimi. DeepSeek returned valid JSON with exact schema compliance, all 5 pattern checks passed. The JSON was well-structured with sensible values. For production agentic pipelines that depend on machine-parseable output, DeepSeek matches Kimi's excellence here.

**Code Execution Reasoning (0.88)**

Identical score to Kimi. DeepSeek correctly predicted all three print outputs and explained the reference-vs-copy distinction clearly. It lost the same partial point on not fully explaining the slice mechanism (`[:]`), suggesting this is a rubric-level expectation rather than a model limitation.

**Adversarial / Trick Questions (0.75)**

Same score as Kimi, same correct answer (5 minutes). DeepSeek's reasoning was slightly more explicit about the per-machine rate calculation, which earned it the same score but with marginally clearer explanation.

**Recent Knowledge / World Events (0.50)**

Here's an interesting divergence. Asked about the June 2025 G7 summit, DeepSeek correctly stated its knowledge cutoff was **May 2025** — which is accurate. Kimi incorrectly claimed **April 2024**, a hallucinated limitation. Both models appropriately declined to answer, but DeepSeek's self-awareness about its own knowledge boundary was more precise. This is a small but meaningful signal of calibration.

### ❌ Where DeepSeek-V4-Pro Struggles

**Complex Multi-Step Reasoning (0.25)**

Same score as Kimi, same failure mode. The logic puzzle (five friends, five positions, five constraints) defeated both models. DeepSeek spent 75 seconds and hit the 4000-token limit without converging on the correct answer (Dave in position 4). The thinking time didn't help — more tokens, same wrong result.

This is important: "thinking" doesn't automatically mean "better at hard logic puzzles." DeepSeek's chain-of-thought added verbosity without adding accuracy on this specific test. The model was spinning, not converging.

**Algorithm Explanation (0.35)**

Worse than Kimi's 0.50. The prompt asked for "exactly 3 sentences" explaining binary search. DeepSeek gave 2 extremely long, run-on sentences that technically contained the right information but failed the structural constraint. Kimi at least gave 4 sentences — closer to the target. DeepSeek's tendency toward dense, compound sentences hurt it here.

**Debugging (0.50)**

Identical to Kimi. Both models correctly identified that the presented code was actually fine, but neither went deep enough on edge case analysis to earn full rubric credit. The test design itself may be the issue here — it's testing whether models hallucinate bugs, and both passed that bar.

**Content Generation (0.50)**

Same score as Kimi, different failure mode. DeepSeek stayed closer to the word count target and respected the banned words constraint, but it drifted into discussing its own "experience" with API rate limits (likely training data contamination from Ollama service discussions). Kimi did the same drift. Both models struggle to write about rate limiting without referencing their own operational context.

**Long-Context RAG (0.50)**

Same score as Kimi, slightly different pattern. DeepSeek correctly identified the McKinsey stat (72%) and partially identified Dr. Sarah Chen's AI-TDI work, but missed the MIT CSAIL attribution and two of the three emerging paradigms. Kimi got the McKinsey stat but completely missed Chen's affiliation. Both models show the same "fade toward the end" pattern in long documents.

**Tool Use / Function Calling (0.50)**

Same as Kimi — listed function calls with correct parameters but no native execution. This is an Ollama endpoint limitation, not a model limitation. Both models understood what to call; the harness just couldn't validate execution.

**Edge Case Handling (0.50)**

Same score as Kimi. Both models correctly asked clarifying questions rather than hallucinating trip details. DeepSeek was slightly more thorough in listing what it needed (departure location, duration, temperature preferences, ground transport constraints).

**Summarization Fidelity (0.50)**

Same score as Kimi. Word count was acceptable, but both models missed key facts from the quantum computing article (independent physicist caution, stock movement, IPO price context). DeepSeek's summary was slightly more complete but still not rubric-compliant.

## Head-to-Head: DeepSeek-V4-Pro vs. KimiK2.6

| Test | DeepSeek | Kimi | Winner | Margin |
|------|:--------:|:----:|--------|--------|
| Basic Reasoning | 0.70 | 0.70 | **Tie** | — |
| Code Generation | **0.70** | 0.60 | DeepSeek | +0.10 |
| Debugging | 0.50 | 0.50 | **Tie** | — |
| Algorithm Explanation | 0.35 | **0.50** | Kimi | +0.15 |
| Complex Reasoning | 0.25 | 0.25 | **Tie** | — |
| Content Generation | 0.50 | 0.50 | **Tie** | — |
| Edge Case Handling | 0.50 | 0.50 | **Tie** | — |
| Long-Context RAG | 0.50 | 0.50 | **Tie** | — |
| Structured Output | **1.00** | **1.00** | **Tie** | — |
| Tool Use | 0.50 | 0.50 | **Tie** | — |
| Instruction Following | **0.70** | 0.50 | **DeepSeek** | **+0.20** |
| Adversarial | 0.75 | 0.75 | **Tie** | — |
| Code Execution | 0.88 | 0.88 | **Tie** | — |
| Summarization | 0.50 | 0.50 | **Tie** | — |
| Recent Knowledge | 0.50 | 0.50 | **Tie** | — |

**Scorecard:** DeepSeek wins 2 tests, Kimi wins 1 test, 12 tests tied.
**Overall:** DeepSeek 0.72 vs Kimi 0.66

### The Speed Tax

Here's the cost of DeepSeek's thinking:

| Metric | DeepSeek | Kimi | Difference |
|--------|----------|------|------------|
| Avg Time to First Token | **17.5s** | 2.2s | **+15.3s** |
| Avg Total Time | 35.0s | 35.2s | -0.2s |
| Avg Tokens/Second | 48.5 | 50.3 | -1.8/s |

DeepSeek takes **nearly 8x longer** to produce its first token. For basic reasoning, it burned 17.9 seconds before outputting a single character. For content generation, the TTF was only 0.4s but total time ballooned to 112s (hitting the token limit).

The total time averages are nearly identical because Kimi generates more tokens faster, while DeepSeek thinks longer then generates more efficiently. But from a user experience perspective, **17 seconds of silence feels very different from 2 seconds**.

## The Verdict

### Who is DeepSeek-V4-Pro actually for?

**Precision tasks with complex constraints** — the instruction following test revealed DeepSeek's real strength. When your prompt has multiple simultaneous rules (word counts, banned words, formatting requirements), DeepSeek *engages* with the constraints rather than ignoring them. It may not satisfy all of them, but it demonstrates understanding of what you're asking. Kimi just... doesn't try as hard.

**Research and analysis workflows** — the higher code generation score and better knowledge cutoff calibration suggest DeepSeek is more carefully aligned for analytical work. The "thinking" overhead pays off when you need thoroughness over speed.

**NOT for:** Time-sensitive interactive use, quick back-and-forth conversations, or any workflow where 17 seconds of latency kills the experience. If you're building a chatbot that needs to feel responsive, DeepSeek will frustrate users.

**NOT for:** Complex logic puzzles either. Despite the thinking time, DeepSeek didn't outperform Kimi on the hardest reasoning test. Both hit the same wall.

### Production Readiness Score: 6.5/10

DeepSeek-V4-Pro is a **specialist, not a generalist**. It scores higher overall than KimiK2.6, but the win comes from a narrower set of strengths (instruction following, code generation) rather than broad superiority. The speed penalty is real and significant — 8x slower TTF is a hard cost to justify unless the task specifically benefits from deliberate reasoning.

The 100% reliability score (zero errors, zero timeouts across 15 tests) is excellent and matches Kimi's rock-solid operational stability. Both models are trustworthy in production; the choice between them depends on whether your use case values speed or constraint precision more highly.

## The Ollama Context

Same caveat as last week: Ollama Cloud's rate limiting is becoming a operational concern. We've seen 429 errors during peak hours, and the increasing load from "thinking" models like DeepSeek may exacerbate this. DeepSeek's longer TTF means each request occupies server resources longer, potentially making rate limit collisions more likely under load.

For mission-critical workloads, consider: DeepSeek for batch analysis jobs where latency doesn't matter, Kimi for interactive workloads where responsiveness is paramount.
