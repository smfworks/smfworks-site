# OpenClaw v2026.4.5: Built-in Video and Music Generation Is Here

OpenClaw just dropped version 2026.4.5, and this one matters.

If you've been watching the AI space, you've seen plenty of model announcements. Most of them require you to learn new tools, sign up for new services, and figure out where to plug the API key. OpenClaw's approach is different — everything comes through the same chat interface you already use to manage your calendar, automate your home, or handle customer inquiries.

The 2026.4.5 release adds two capabilities that push OpenClaw further into the content production space: **built-in video generation** and **built-in music generation**. Both are accessible directly from your AI assistant, with no new tools to learn.

Here's what changed and why it matters for small businesses.

## Built-In Video Generation

The `video_generate` tool is now part of OpenClaw's core toolkit. It supports:

- **MiniMax Hailuo 2.3** — the standard model for 6-second or 10-second video clips
- **MiniMax Hailuo 2.3-Fast** — faster generation at 768p resolution
- **First-frame modes** — start from a text prompt or provide an image to anchor the first frame
- **Prompt expansion** — automatic prompt enhancement for better results

The practical use cases for small businesses are straightforward:

- A contractor generates a quick video walkthrough of a project site before and after
- A restaurant creates a short promo clip for social media from a still photo
- A retailer produces a rotating product showcase without hiring a video editor

Because the video generation is integrated into OpenClaw's workflow, you can combine it with other tools. Ask your AI to generate a video, then have it draft the social media caption, schedule the post, and track engagement — all in the same conversation.

## Built-In Music Generation

The `music_generate` tool brings the same simplicity to audio:

- **MiniMax Music 2.5** — generates tracks with lyrics (requires a lyric prompt)
- **MiniMax Music 2.5+** — instrumental tracks for Token Plan+ subscribers
- **Duration control** — up to 300 seconds per track
- **Async delivery** — OpenClaw tracks the generation task and delivers the finished audio when it's ready

For businesses that need audio but don't have a composer on staff:

- A podcast intro/outro without licensing concerns
- Background music for customer-facing videos
- A unique hold message for your business phone instead of generic recorded music

The generation is async because music (like video) takes time to produce. OpenClaw handles the polling and delivers the result to you when it's ready — no checking back, no refreshing.

## The /dreaming Feature Is Now Real

The `/dreaming` command — which OpenClaw has been building toward for several releases — is now generally available. It enables a more free-form, creative generation mode where the AI explores ideas without the constraints of strict task execution.

In practical terms, `/dreaming` gives you a space to:

- Explore creative directions for content before committing to a final format
- Brainstorm visual concepts that might become videos or images
- Sketch out audio concepts before final production

Think of it as the difference between brainstorming with a colleague versus writing a formal brief. `/dreaming` is the former — loose, exploratory, and often surprisingly useful as a first step.

## Structured Task Progress

If you've ever started a complex task with an AI agent and wondered "is it actually making progress or did it get stuck?", this update addresses that.

OpenClaw 2026.4.5 introduces structured task progress — visible indicators that show where a multi-step task stands. The AI now reports progress during tool execution, making it clearer what's happening during longer workflows.

For businesses running automated pipelines — customer onboarding flows, content production chains, data processing jobs — the visibility improvement is meaningful. You spend less time wondering what's happening and more time trusting that the automation is working.

## Prompt Cache Improvements

The release also includes better prompt-cache reuse, which OpenClaw says reduces latency by roughly 30% for repeated or similar queries. This matters most for workflows that loop — processing multiple similar items, running batch operations, or any scenario where the same context gets reused across runs.

For small businesses running AI-assisted operations at scale, the cumulative time savings add up.

## GPT-5.4 and Codex Got Better Too

The OpenClaw team also improved how existing models perform in real workflows:

- **GPT-5 and GPT-5.4** respond faster with less verbose output — they act more, explain less
- **Visible progress** during tool execution so you know what's happening
- **One-shot retry** if a model describes what it would do instead of actually doing it
- **Commentary buffering** keeps planning text from leaking into your final answer

These changes make the models feel more like assistants and less like colleagues who send you their thought process instead of just doing the work.

## Control UI Speaks More Languages

OpenClaw's Control UI and documentation now support 12 additional languages, making it more accessible for teams working across language barriers. If you're deploying OpenClaw internationally or working with multilingual teams, this reduces the friction of getting everyone onboarded.

## What This Means for Your Business

The video and music generation capabilities in OpenClaw 2026.4.5 aren't replacing professional production tools. They're replacing the friction of "I need a quick video clip" — the kind of thing that used to mean either doing it yourself with complicated software or paying someone and waiting a week.

Now you can say: "Generate a 6-second video of our storefront at sunset" and get a usable asset in minutes.

The same applies to music. A unique hold message, a podcast intro, background audio for a client presentation — these are all things small businesses need but can't justify the cost of custom production for.

OpenClaw is betting that the answer isn't more tools. It's making the tools you already use do more.

## The Competitive Angle

This release also arrives as OpenClaw notes that Anthropic access has been restricted and GPT-5.4 has improved — prompting a strategic shift in the provider stack. The OpenClaw team is positioning this as a pivot toward capability rather than a limitation: the video and music generation features are built on MiniMax, not Anthropic, and they're features that differentiate OpenClaw from pure LLM wrappers.

The practical takeaway: multi-provider fallback architectures are now table stakes for serious AI deployment. OpenClaw's built-in failover, combined with the new media generation tools, makes the platform more self-sufficient.
