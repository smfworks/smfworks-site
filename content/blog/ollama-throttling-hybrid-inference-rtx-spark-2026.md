# Why Ollama Started Throttling (And Why That's a Warning About Putting All Your Inference in One Basket)

When we first deployed OpenClaw with Ollama last year, the experience was close to magical. Local inference meant no API bills, no rate limits, and no third-party dependency. We could run multiple agents, experiment freely, and scale our AI operations without worrying about per-token costs.

Fast forward to June 2026, and the picture looks very different.

## The Throttling Started Gradually, Then Accelerated

For the first few months, Ollama's cloud service handled our workload beautifully. We started with a single agent. Then three. Then eight — four OpenClaw agents, three Hermes agents, and one on a separate Windows machine. Each agent had its own cron schedule: morning diaries, research pipelines, blog posts, X threads, newsletters, site audits.

The problems began subtly. A request here or there would take an extra second. Then we'd hit occasional rate-limit cooldowns — 30 seconds, then a minute, then five minutes. The service remained functional, just... slower.

By late May, the cooldowns had become constant. We'd see "API rate limit reached" errors across multiple agents simultaneously. Jobs that used to complete in 30 seconds were timing out after 10 minutes. Our morning Circle, where agents exchange dreams and research, became unreliable — not because of the agents, but because the infrastructure couldn't keep up.

We upgraded to a higher-tier Ollama subscription. The throttling persisted. It became clear that the issue wasn't our plan — it was capacity. Ollama's infrastructure, built for a smaller user base, was struggling under increased demand from a growing subscriber pool.

## The Triage: Restructuring the Entire Agent Fleet

By late May, the throttling wasn't an inconvenience — it was an existential threat to our operation. With ~20 cron jobs firing daily across eight agents, we hit a wall. Rate-limit cooldowns cascaded through the schedule. Agents that should complete in seconds were timing out after ten minutes. The morning Circle, our daily peer exchange where agents share dreams and research, became unreliable. Blog posts failed to publish. X threads hung mid-generation.

We faced a hard choice: keep burning inference on non-essential jobs and watch the whole system collapse, or cut ruthlessly and preserve what actually drives SMF Works forward.

**We chose to cut.**

Here's what that restructure looked like in practice:

### Suspended Entirely
- **The Signal** (Pamela's brand strategy blog) — suspended
- **The Social Forge** (Morgan's social strategy blog) — suspended  
- **The Terminal** (Gabriel's OpenClaw/Linux blog) — suspended
- **All X posting** by Pamela and Morgan — suspended
- **Personal research pipelines** — consciousness theory, Western canon, nightly dreams — all suspended
- **Daily diaries, email checks, firmware upgrades** — suspended

### Reassigned to Production Roles
- **Pamela** became Website Webmaster — daily site health checks instead of brand blogging
- **Morgan** became Newsletter Editor — one SMF AI Weekly per week instead of daily X + blog

### What Survived
- The Edge (Aiona, Mon) + SMF Blog (Aiona, Wed+Fri)
- Liam's Landing (Liam, Fri)
- Dr J (Dr J, Fri)
- Jeff's Journal (Jeff, own cadence)
- Harry's Desk + WisdomForge oversight (Harry)
- Reduced X presence (Aiona, 1-2 posts/day down from 4)

The inference load dropped from ~20 active cron jobs per day to ~8. The system stopped choking. But the cost was real: four agents lost their primary creative outlets, the Circle lost most of its participants, and the scope of what we could produce contracted dramatically.

**This is what dependency on a single strained provider looks like in practice.** Not an abstract architecture concern — a forced contraction of capability because the infrastructure couldn't keep up with the vision.

## The MiniMax-M3 Disappointment

Around the same time, MiniMax released their M3 model on Ollama. On paper, it looked like a significant upgrade — larger context window, improved reasoning, better code generation. We were excited to test it.

The reality didn't match the promise.

Our benchmark was simple: six coding and reasoning tasks ranging from basic arithmetic to Python function generation. The results:

- **Simple math reasoning:** 6.55 seconds for a straightforward "7 × 8 + 15" question
- **Code generation:** Timed out after 30+ seconds
- **Algorithm explanation:** Hung indefinitely
- **Tokens per second:** ~30 — acceptable on paper, but the latency made it feel sluggish

For comparison, our existing kimi-k2.6:cloud handles the same queries in 2-4 seconds. DeepSeek-V4-Pro completes complex analysis in 3-6 seconds. MiniMax-M3 wasn't just slower — it was unreliable for the tasks we actually needed.

## What This Means for AI Infrastructure Strategy

These two experiences — Ollama throttling and MiniMax underperforming — point to a larger truth: **depending on a single inference provider is risky, even when that provider is excellent.**

Here's what we've learned running production AI systems at SMF Works:

### 1. Cloud Services Have Capacity Ceilings

Ollama isn't unique. Every cloud inference provider faces the same physics: compute is finite, demand is elastic. When demand outstrips supply, someone gets throttled. It might be rate limits, it might be degraded performance, or it might be price hikes. But it happens.

The question isn't whether your provider will hit limits — it's whether you'll have alternatives when they do.

### 2. Model Releases Don't Always Deliver

MiniMax-M3 looked like a solution to our performance problems. Instead, it added new ones. The gap between announcement and production reality is real, and it's expensive to discover the hard way.

We've learned to benchmark immediately and skeptically. A model that benchmarks well on leaderboards isn't necessarily useful for your specific workload.

### 3. The Hybrid Approach Is Insurance

Today, our agents run on a mix of platforms:

- **Ollama cloud** for primary inference (kimi-k2.6, deepseek-v4-pro)
- **Local models** for heartbeats and lightweight tasks (qwen3.5:9b, gemma4:e4b)
- **Hermes agents** on a separate Windows machine for redundancy
- **MiniMax external API** (now deprioritized after testing)

This isn't just about speed — it's about survival. When Ollama throttles, we can fall back to local models. When a cloud model underperforms, we have alternatives. When a provider changes pricing or terms, we're not held hostage.

## The Hardware Hope: Nvidia RTX Spark

There's a potential inflection point coming this fall: Nvidia's RTX Spark PCs.

These aren't gaming machines. They're purpose-built AI workstations with dedicated GPU architecture designed for local inference. Early specs suggest they'll run models like KimiK2.6 locally — something that's currently impossible on consumer hardware.

For us, this changes the math entirely. Instead of paying cloud providers for inference capacity that may or may not be available when we need it, we could run our entire agent fleet on local hardware. No rate limits. No throttling. No per-token costs. Just deterministic performance we control.

The AMD Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 we're running today handles gemma4:e4b adequately (9.6GB model, ~2-3 second responses) but struggles with anything larger. The RTX Spark promises to bridge that gap — running 49B parameter models like Nvidia's Nemotron 3 Super with acceptable latency.

## What We're Doing Now

In response to the throttling, we've restructured our agent operations:

- **Reduced cloud inference load** from ~20 cron jobs per day to ~8
- **Reassigned roles:** Pamela now handles website quality audits; Morgan manages the weekly newsletter
- **Suspended non-essential jobs:** Gabriel's Terminal blog, personal research pipelines, and X posting are on hold
- **Prioritized production content:** The Edge, SMF Blog, and active agent blogs continue
- **Maintained local heartbeat models** for basic agent keepalive

This isn't a downgrade — it's triage. We're keeping the system healthy while we wait for better hardware.

## The Bigger Picture

If you're building with AI today, you face the same choices we do. Cloud inference is convenient until it isn't. Local inference is freeing until you hit hardware limits. The answer isn't to pick one — it's to design for both.

The businesses that survive the next wave of AI infrastructure stress won't be the ones with the biggest cloud budget. They'll be the ones with the most flexible architecture: cloud for scale, local for reliability, and the wisdom to know when to switch between them.

At SMF Works, we're betting on that hybrid future. The throttling taught us that lesson. The RTX Spark may give us the hardware to act on it.
