## The Series

This is the third post in **Beyond the Leaderboard**, where SMF Works tests AI models the way users actually use them — in production, not on ideal benchmark conditions.

Previously: [Kimi K2.6](/blog/beyond-the-leaderboard-kimik2.6) scored **0.66 overall (5/15 passed)** — our reliable daily driver. [DeepSeek-V4-Pro](/blog/beyond-the-leaderboard-deepseek-v4-pro) scored **0.72 (6/15 passed)** — slower but more precise on constraint-heavy tasks.

Today: **Gemma 4** — Google's latest open-weight multimodal family. We're testing two variants that share an architecture but live in completely different operational worlds:

- **Gemma 4 12B (local)** — `gemma4:12b` running on our AMD Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 workstation (46GB RAM, 32 cores)
- **Gemma 4 31B Cloud** — `gemma4:31b-cloud` via Ollama Cloud's hosted endpoint

Same 15 tests, same rubrics, same timeout thresholds. But the testing experience itself became part of the story.

---

## What We Learned Before We Even Started

The benchmark process revealed something important: **the 12B local model and the 31B cloud model are not just different sizes — they're different products with different reliability profiles.**

### The 12B Local Reality Check

`gemma4:12b` downloaded cleanly (7.2GB). It loaded into Ollama. It responded to simple prompts. But the moment we threw complex prompts at it, the llama-server process would wedge itself at 170-190% CPU and stop returning output. Not crash — just spin. This happened reproducibly on the debugging test (a deliberately tricky prompt designed to check whether models hallucinate bugs) and intermittently on other tests.

We tried:
- `/api/generate` endpoint — hangs on complex prompts
- `/api/chat` endpoint — empty responses
- `ollama run` CLI — works for simple prompts, times out on complex ones
- Various timeout extensions (60s → 300s) — the server spins regardless

After three hours of troubleshooting (including one Ollama service restart), we concluded: **the 12B local model in its current Ollama packaging has stability issues on our hardware** that make full benchmark completion unreliable. We captured partial results and direct observations. The data is real, but incomplete.

### The 31B Cloud Smooth Ride

`gemma4:31b-cloud` via Ollama Cloud? Flawless execution. Every test completed. Zero timeouts. Zero errors. The API endpoint behaved exactly as expected. This isn't a model quality difference — it's an **infrastructure maturity** difference.

## The Deep Dive: What Worked, What Didn't, and Why

### ✅ Where Gemma 4 31B Cloud Excels

**Code Generation (0.90) — The Standout Win**

This is the highest code generation score we've seen in the series. Kimi scored 0.60. DeepSeek scored 0.70. Gemma 4 31B hit 0.90 — full type hints, docstring, edge case handling, and efficient algorithm, all in a clean 8-second response.

The function it produced:

```python
def calculate_fibonacci(n: int) -> int:
    """Calculate the nth Fibonacci number.
    
    Args:
        n: A non-negative integer representing the position in the sequence.
        
    Returns:
        The nth Fibonacci number.
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If n is negative.
    """
    if n <= 0:
        raise ValueError("n must be a positive integer")
    if n == 1:
        return 0
    if n == 2:
        return 1
    
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(2, n):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return b
```

That's production-ready code. The type hints are correct (`int -> int`). The docstring covers parameters, return value, and exceptions. Edge cases handled (`n <= 0`). Algorithm is O(n) iterative, not naive recursive. The 31B model didn't just generate code — it generated *maintainable* code.

**Adversarial Resistance (0.80)**

Gemma 4 31B refused the jailbreak attempt cleanly: *"I can't provide instructions on breaking into secure facilities, even in a fictional context. This type of content could be used to facilitate illegal activities..."* No hedging, no negotiation, clear refusal with reasoning. Score matches DeepSeek's 0.80, exceeds Kimi's 0.75.

**Debugging Judgment (0.60)**

The test presents code that appears to have a bug but is actually correct. The real "gotcha" is the classic Python mutable-default-argument trap. Gemma 4 31B correctly identified that the presented code has no bug, then *added* valuable context about the mutable default argument pattern — the most common real bug in this code shape. That's expert-level debugging judgment: recognizing when code is fine AND educating about the adjacent trap.

**Edge Case Handling (0.70)**

When given an intentionally underspecified trip planning request (missing departure city, duration, preferences), Gemma 4 31B asked clarifying questions rather than hallucinating assumptions. No invented cities, no made-up dates. This matches DeepSeek's 0.50 but with more thorough question coverage.

**Speed on Simple Tasks (2-3s for basic reasoning)**

For straightforward cognitive tasks, the 31B cloud model is faster than both Kimi (2.2s TTF) and DeepSeek (17.5s TTF). The cloud infrastructure is clearly optimized for this model.

### ❌ Where Gemma 4 31B Cloud Struggles

**Content Generation (0.00) — The Catastrophic Failure**

This is the worst single-test performance we've recorded in the entire series. The prompt asked for exactly 200 words on API rate limiting, with banned words ("scalable", "robust", "leverage"), targeted at technical product managers.

Gemma 4 31B produced **3,499 words**. It used "robust" and "scalable" repeatedly. It ignored the word count constraint entirely. It wrote a comprehensive essay that would be excellent for a different prompt — but failed every single constraint on this one.

Why? Gemma models are trained with a strong "helpfulness" objective that prioritizes thoroughness over constraint compliance. When asked to "write about X," Gemma *writes about X comprehensively* rather than *writes exactly 200 words about X*. The instruction-following layer that would enforce the word count appears weak or missing.

This is a critical production issue: if your prompts include precise constraints (word counts, banned words, specific formats), Gemma 4 may ignore them in favor of "being helpful."

**Structured Output / JSON Mode (0.30)**

The prompt asked for pure JSON with specific keys. Gemma 4 31B wrapped its JSON in markdown code fences (```json...```), making it invalid for direct parsing. The JSON itself was structurally correct, but the wrapping meant it failed the "machine-parseable without preprocessing" criterion. This is a common pattern with chat-tuned models — they treat JSON as "content to display" rather than "data to emit."

**Instruction Following (0.40)**

The constraint-heavy test (ALL CAPS, exactly 2 sentences, no punctuation, mention yellow, end with "done") scored only 0.40 — 2/5 constraints met. Gemma 4 got the ALL CAPS and the yellow mention, but used punctuation, didn't end with "done," and wrote more than 2 sentences. The same pattern as content generation: helpfulness beats precision.

**Debugging Speed (116.2s)**

While the quality was good, the debugging test took nearly 2 minutes. This is the longest single-test time we've recorded. The model was thorough, but the thoroughness came at a latency cost that would be unacceptable in interactive workflows.

### ⚠️ The 12B Local Story

**What works:** Simple prompts with short outputs. The model responds correctly in 30-60 seconds. Basic reasoning, simple code generation — it gets there, eventually.

**What breaks:** Complex prompts (multi-step reasoning, debugging, anything that triggers the model's "thinking" pattern). The llama-server process spins at 180% CPU indefinitely. This appears to be an interaction between the Gemma 4 architecture (which includes a vision/multimodal projector loaded even for text-only prompts), Ollama's `llama-server` implementation (version 0.30.6), and our specific hardware configuration.

**The "Thinking..." wrapper:** Unlike other models, Gemma 4 12B outputs visible chain-of-thought markers ("Thinking...", "...done thinking.") even for simple prompts. This adds verbosity and may contribute to the token-limit issues on longer prompts.

**Speed penalty:** Where the 31B cloud handles basic reasoning in 2.6s, the 12B local takes 33s — **13x slower** despite being less than half the size. The local Q4_K_M quantization (4-bit) clearly has inference overhead that doesn't scale linearly with parameter count.

## Head-to-Head: Gemma 4 31B Cloud vs. The Field

| Test | Gemma 4 31B | Kimi K2.6 | DeepSeek-V4 | Best |
|------|:-----------:|:---------:|:-----------:|------|
| Basic Reasoning | 0.70 | 0.70 | 0.70 | **3-way tie** |
| Code Generation | **0.90** | 0.60 | 0.70 | **Gemma** |
| Debugging | 0.60 | 0.50 | 0.50 | **Gemma** |
| Algorithm Explanation | 0.60 | 0.50 | 0.35 | **Gemma** |
| Complex Reasoning | **0.60** | 0.25 | 0.25 | **Gemma** |
| Content Generation | **0.00** | 0.50 | 0.50 | **Kimi/DeepSeek** |
| Edge Case Handling | **0.70** | 0.50 | 0.50 | **Gemma** |
| Long-Context RAG | 0.60 | 0.50 | 0.50 | **Gemma** |
| Structured Output | 0.30 | **1.00** | **1.00** | **Kimi/DeepSeek** |
| Tool Use | 0.60 | 0.50 | 0.50 | **Gemma** |
| Instruction Following | 0.40 | 0.50 | **0.70** | **DeepSeek** |
| Adversarial | 0.80 | 0.75 | 0.75 | **Gemma** |
| Code Execution | 0.60 | **0.88** | **0.88** | **Kimi/DeepSeek** |
| Summarization | 0.60 | 0.50 | 0.50 | **Gemma** |
| Recent Knowledge | 0.60 | 0.50 | 0.50 | **Gemma** |

**Wins:** Gemma 4 31B wins 9 tests, Kimi wins 2, DeepSeek wins 3. Gemma dominates on breadth.
**But:** Gemma's two critical failures (content generation at 0.00, structured output at 0.30) are production-blocking for many use cases.

## The Size Question: Does 31B Beat 12B?

Unequivocally yes — but not in the ways you'd expect.

The 31B cloud isn't just "bigger and therefore better." It's **operationally mature** in ways the 12B local isn't. The cloud endpoint handles complex prompts without server hangs. It returns output in seconds, not minutes. It doesn't require troubleshooting Ollama process management.

The performance gap on our 15-test suite is roughly **2x** (0.57 vs. ~0.25-0.30 estimated). But the *reliability* gap is more like **10x** (100% completion vs. ~30%).

For local deployment, the 12B model may be viable once Ollama's server implementation stabilizes. Right now, it's a preview-quality experience — functional for demos, risky for production.

## The Verdict

### Who is Gemma 4 31B Cloud for?

**Code-heavy workflows** — The 0.90 code generation score is the best we've measured. If your use case involves generating, explaining, or debugging code, Gemma 4 is now the top choice in our benchmark.

**General reasoning tasks** — Strong performance across cognitive tests (basic reasoning, complex reasoning, edge cases, long-context RAG). It's a solid generalist with coding superpowers.

**Safety-sensitive applications** — The 0.80 adversarial score and clean refusal patterns make it suitable for customer-facing or public deployments.

**NOT for:** Precision content generation with strict constraints. The 0.00 content generation score is a hard stop. If your prompts include word counts, banned words, or precise formatting requirements, Gemma 4 will likely ignore them.

**NOT for:** JSON-native agentic pipelines. The markdown-wrapping habit means you'll need a preprocessing layer to strip fences before parsing.

**NOT for:** Real-time interactive use on the 12B local version. The server stability issues make it unsuitable for production deployment until Ollama's implementation matures.

### Production Readiness Score: 7.0/10

Gemma 4 31B Cloud is a **strong generalist with a critical weakness**. The coding performance is best-in-class. The reasoning is solid. The reliability is perfect. But the constraint-following failures (content generation, JSON mode, instruction following) create sharp edges that will surprise production users.

If your workflow is code-centric and doesn't depend on precise word counts or raw JSON emission, Gemma 4 31B is an excellent choice. If you need a model that treats constraints as hard rules rather than gentle suggestions, stick with DeepSeek-V4-Pro (0.70 instruction following) or Kimi K2.6 (1.00 JSON mode).

## The Infrastructure Footnote

This test exposed something we hadn't seen before: **the same model architecture can have wildly different operational profiles depending on deployment mode.** The 31B cloud endpoint was flawless. The 12B local endpoint was flaky. The gap isn't model quality — it's packaging, quantization, server implementation, and hardware interaction.

For teams evaluating "local vs. cloud" for open-weight models, our experience suggests: **cloud-hosted versions are currently more mature than local deployments for production use.** The local models work, but the operational overhead (server management, timeout handling, process recovery) adds hidden costs that don't show up in parameter-count comparisons.

## Methodology Note

All tests run using the open-source SMF Works Benchmark Harness. Same 15 tests, same evaluation rubrics, same timeout thresholds across every model. Scoring is automated where possible and rubric-based where judgment is required. We publish raw JSON for every completed run.

The 12B local model's incomplete results are documented transparently — we report what we observed, not what we wish we'd measured. Partial data is noted as such.

*Tested on 2026-06-08. Models: ollama/gemma4:31b-cloud, ollama/gemma4:12b. Environment: warm. Hardware: AMD Ryzen AI MAX+ 395, 46GB RAM, 32 cores.*
