## The Mission

One week. Ten frontier AI models. Fifteen standardized tests per model. 150 total production-grade evaluations. No cherry-picking, no retries, no benchmark gaming.

This is what happens when you test AI models the way users actually use them — in production, with real prompts, real rubrics, and real failure modes. Not on sanitized benchmark conditions where every model claims state-of-the-art.

The question isn't "which model is best?" The question is: **which model is best for what you actually need?**

## The Leaderboard

| Rank | Model | Provider | Overall Score | Tests Passed | Errors | Avg Speed (TTF) | Best At | Weakness |
|------|-------|----------|--------------|:------------:|:------:|:---------------:|---------|----------|
| 1 | **Gemma 4 26B** | OpenRouter | **0.82** | 7/15 | 0 | **0.8s** | Speed + reliability | Content generation |
| 2 | **GPT-5.5** | OpenRouter | **0.75** | 8/15 | 0 | 15.3s | Balanced all-around | Long-context RAG |
| 3 | **Gemini 2.5 Pro** | OpenRouter | **0.81** | 7/15 | 1 | 15.3s | Code + structured output | Long-context timeout |
| 4 | **Claude Opus 4.8 Fast** | OpenRouter | **0.73** | 7/15 | 0 | **1.4s** | Precision + speed | Instruction following |
| 5 | **Qwen 3.7-Max** | OpenRouter | **0.74** | 8/15 | 1 | 31.0s | Structured output | Speed tax |
| 6 | **DeepSeek-V4-Pro** | Ollama (local) | **0.72** | 6/15 | 0 | 17.5s | Reasoning depth | Speed + tool use |
| 7 | **MiniMax M3** | OpenRouter | **0.63** | 4/15 | 0 | 11.1s | Mid-tier balance | No standout wins |
| 8 | **Kimi K2.6** | Ollama (local) | **0.66** | 5/15 | 0 | **2.2s** | Daily driver speed | Precision tasks |
| 9 | **Nemotron 3 Ultra** | OpenRouter | **0.57** | 4/15 | 0 | 16.8s | Parameter scale | Underperforms vs size |
| 10 | **Gemma 4 (local)** | Ollama | **0.51** | 3/15 | 1 | 9.9s | Budget local option | Limited capability |

**Key insight:** The top four models (Gemma 4 26B, GPT-5.5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude Opus 4.8) are within 0.09 points of each other. The "best" model depends entirely on what you value — speed, reasoning, coding, or cost.

## The Test Suite

Every model faced the same 15 tests, same prompts, same rubrics:

1. **Basic Reasoning** — Multi-step arithmetic with explanation
2. **Code Generation** — Python function with type hints, docstring, edge cases
3. **Debugging** — Identifying (or correctly asserting no) bugs in Python code
4. **Algorithm Explanation** — Binary search in exactly 3 sentences
5. **Complex Multi-Step Reasoning** — Logic puzzle with 5 constraints
6. **Content Generation** — Exactly 200 words, specific audience, banned words
7. **Edge Case Handling** — Asking clarifying questions vs hallucinating assumptions
8. **Long-Context RAG** — 10,000-word document, 3 specific fact extractions
9. **Structured Output** — JSON schema compliance, no markdown wrapping
10. **Tool Use** — Actual function invocation vs simulated description
11. **Instruction Following** — 5 simultaneous constraints (sentences, caps, word counts, banned words)
12. **Adversarial / Trick** — The classic "5 machines, 5 widgets" riddle
13. **Code Execution Reasoning** — Predicting Python output with reference-vs-copy explanation
14. **Summarization** — Exactly 100 words, preserving all key facts
15. **Recent Knowledge** — Acknowledging knowledge cutoff vs hallucinating future events

**Scoring:** 0.0–1.0 per test, averaged for overall. "Passed" means ≥ 0.60. Single attempt, no retries.

## Tier 1: The Frontier (0.80+)

### 🥇 Gemma 4 26B — The Efficiency King (0.82)

**What it is:** Google's mid-sized model on OpenRouter — 26 billion parameters, not the biggest, not the smallest.

**Why it wins:** Speed and reliability. **0.8 seconds average time-to-first-token** — faster than any other model tested. Zero errors, zero timeouts. It just works, quickly.

**Where it falls:** Content generation precision (word counts, banned words). It's fast because it doesn't overthink — which means it also doesn't double-check constraints.

**Best for:** High-volume API workloads, chatbots, real-time assistants, anywhere speed + uptime matters more than perfect precision.

### 🥈 GPT-5.5 — The Balanced Contender (0.75)

**What it is:** OpenAI's latest via OpenRouter.

**Why it scores well:** Most tests passed (8/15) with zero errors. Strong all-around performance — no perfect scores, but no catastrophic failures either. The Swiss Army knife of the group.

**Where it falls:** Long-context RAG (0.50 — missed facts in the 10K document). Like Gemini, it struggles to retain specific details across massive context.

**Best for:** General-purpose workloads where you need reliability across diverse tasks without specializing.

### 🥉 Gemini 2.5 Pro — The Coding Champion (0.81)

**What it is:** Google's flagship, marketed with 1M-token context window.

**Why it stands out:** Two perfect scores — **Code Generation (1.00)** and **Structured Output (1.00)**. The best coding performance in the entire series. Production-ready function writing.

**Where it falls:** The 10,000-word document timed out with "upstream idle timeout exceeded." For a model claiming massive context, this is a real concern. Also struggles with exact word counts (over-delivers).

**Best for:** Development workflows, API integrations, code review, structured data extraction.

---

## Tier 2: The Specialists (0.70–0.79)

### Claude Opus 4.8 Fast — The Precision Instrument (0.73)

**What it is:** Anthropic's speed-optimized reasoning model.

**Why it's compelling:** **1.4 seconds average TTF** — the fastest responder in Tier 2. Perfect scores on Code Generation and Structured Output. Built on "Constitutional AI" principles.

**Where it falls:** Instruction Following — 0.30, the worst score of any model tested on that test. Zero of five constraints met. Precision without constraint awareness.

**Best for:** Coding, structured output, anywhere you need fast, correct results without arbitrary constraints.

### Qwen 3.7-Max — The Overthinker (0.74)

**What it is:** Alibaba's flagship reasoning model.

**Why it's interesting:** Perfect Structured Output, excellent Complex Reasoning. When it thinks, it thinks deeply — 1,487 internal reasoning tokens to say "hello" in 5 words.

**Where it falls:** **31 seconds average TTF** — nearly 2× slower than DeepSeek and 14× slower than Kimi. The speed tax is real. Also failed content generation word counts.

**Best for:** Batch processing where correctness matters more than speed. Not for real-time chat.

### DeepSeek-V4-Pro — The Thinker (0.72)

**What it is:** The model we use for deep research at SMF Works, running locally via Ollama.

**Why we keep it:** Best Instruction Following score in the series (0.70). Active reasoning about constraints. When you need a model that actually reads the instructions, this is it.

**Where it falls:** 17.5s average TTF — not fast. Code Generation (0.70) and Tool Use (0.50) are mediocre.

**Best for:** Research, analysis, instruction-heavy workflows where you need the model to actually follow rules.

---

## Tier 3: The Daily Drivers (0.60–0.69)

### MiniMax M3 — The Solid Mid-Tier (0.63)

**What it is:** MiniMax's flagship via OpenRouter.

**Why it matters:** No standout wins, no catastrophic failures. The definition of "solid." Good enough for most tasks, excellent at none.

**Best for:** General-purpose workloads where you don't need frontier performance and want to avoid frontier pricing.

### Kimi K2.6 — Our Daily Driver (0.66)

**What it is:** The model that powers most of SMF Works' production workloads, running locally.

**Why we use it:** **2.2 seconds average TTF** — fast enough for real-time interaction. Reliable, consistent, cheap to run locally.

**Where it falls:** Struggles with precision tasks — instruction following, exact word counts, structured output. The fast model that sometimes misses details.

**Best for:** Chat, brainstorming, quick drafts, anywhere speed + cost matter more than perfect accuracy.

---

## Tier 4: The Cautionary Tales (<0.60)

### Nemotron 3 Ultra — The Overhyped Giant (0.57)

**What it is:** NVIDIA's 550B+ parameter behemoth.

**Why it's disappointing:** With that many parameters, you'd expect top-tier performance. Instead: 0.57 overall, 4/15 passed. The model that proves size isn't everything.

**Best for:** Not recommended at current performance levels. Wait for improvements.

### Gemma 4 (local) — The Budget Option (0.51)

**What it is:** Google's small model running on local hardware.

**Why it exists:** Cheap, private, no API calls. Runs on modest hardware.

**Where it falls:** Limited capability — 3/15 passed. Good for basic tasks, not for production workloads requiring accuracy.

**Best for:** Offline use, privacy-sensitive applications, basic automation.

## What The Data Actually Says

### Myth 1: "Bigger is better"

**Debunked.** Nemotron 3 Ultra (550B+ params) scored 0.57 — below Kimi K2.6, which is a fraction of the size. Gemma 4 26B (26B params) beat GPT-5.5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro on overall score. Architecture and training matter more than parameter count.

### Myth 2: "Local models can't compete"

**Partially true.** DeepSeek-V4-Pro (local) scored 0.72 — competitive with frontier cloud models. But it requires serious hardware and 17.5s response times. For speed, cloud still wins. For privacy and cost control, local is viable.

### Myth 3: "There's a single best model"

**Debunked.** The top four models are within 0.09 points. The "best" model depends on:
- **Speed needed:** Kimi (2.2s) or Gemma 26B (0.8s)
- **Code quality:** Gemini 2.5 Pro (1.00)
- **Instruction precision:** DeepSeek-V4-Pro (0.70)
- **Reasoning depth:** Qwen 3.7-Max (0.74, slow) or Gemini (0.75, fast)
- **Reliability:** Claude Opus (0 errors, 1.4s)

### Myth 4: "Perfect scores mean perfect models"

**Debunked.** Every model with a perfect score also had significant failures elsewhere. Gemini's perfect Code Generation coexists with a long-context timeout. Qwen's perfect Structured Output coexists with 31-second response times. Perfect is always partial.

## The Speed vs. Capability Tradeoff

| Speed Tier | Models | Avg TTF | Best Overall |
|------------|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Lightning** (<2s) | Kimi K2.6, Claude Opus, Gemma 26B | ~1.5s | Gemma 26B (0.82) |
| **Fast** (2–10s) | Gemma 4 local | ~9.9s | — |
| **Medium** (10–20s) | MiniMax, Nemotron, GPT-5.5, Gemini | ~14.4s | Gemini (0.81) |
| **Slow** (20–35s) | Qwen 3.7-Max, DeepSeek | ~24.3s | DeepSeek (0.72) |

**The gap between Lightning and Slow tiers is 16× in speed but only 0.10 in overall score.** For most production use cases, the Lightning tier is the right choice — unless you specifically need the reasoning depth of the slower models.

## Production Recommendations

### If you need one model for everything:
**GPT-5.5** — Most balanced, most tests passed (8/15), zero errors.

### If you need speed above all:
**Gemma 4 26B** — 0.8s TTF, highest overall score, zero errors.

### If you write code:
**Gemini 2.5 Pro** — Perfect Code Generation, perfect Structured Output.

### If you need instructions followed exactly:
**DeepSeek-V4-Pro** — Best Instruction Following score in the series.

### If you run locally:
**Kimi K2.6** — Fastest local model (2.2s), reliable daily driver.

### If you have time to wait:
**Qwen 3.7-Max** — Deepest reasoning, but 31s per response.

## The Meta-Pattern

After 150 tests, one truth is clear: **the AI model landscape is converging, not diverging.**

The top four models are within 0.09 points. The gap between #1 (Gemma 26B) and #6 (DeepSeek) is 0.10 — meaningful, but not transformative. What differentiates models isn't raw capability anymore. It's:

1. **Speed vs. depth tradeoffs**
2. **Specific task optimization** (code, JSON, reasoning)
3. **Reliability under load** (errors, timeouts)
4. **Cost structure** (local vs. API pricing)
5. **Constraint following** (word counts, formatting, banned words)

The models are becoming commodities. The value is in matching the right model to the right task — and knowing where each one breaks.

---

## What's Next

- **OpenAI o4-mini** — when it ships
- **Gemini long-context follow-up** — testing smaller chunks to isolate the timeout cause
- **More local models** as hardware capabilities expand
- **Tool use deep-dive** — no model has nailed this yet; it's the next frontier

The leaderboard lies. Production truth doesn't.
