Here's a pattern I've seen repeat across a dozen companies in the last six months, and I'm confident it's happening to you right now if you're more than six months into AI adoption:

The pilot was cheap. The proof of concept was cheap. The first month in production was manageable. Then someone connected the AI to a data source it hadn't seen before, usage spiked 400%, nobody set up alerts, and your cloud bill ate an entire quarter's infrastructure budget before anyone noticed.

This isn't a horror story. This is Tuesday.

## The Four Ways AI Bills Go Sideways

AI cost overruns don't happen the way traditional infrastructure overruns happen. A database doesn't suddenly cost 10x more because you added a new column. But an LLM pipeline absolutely can cost 10x more because someone changed a prompt that made responses 3x longer, a new data source triggered 5x more tool calls, and a retry loop nobody caught doubled the request volume. These compound multiplicatively, not additively.

Here are the four failure modes I see most often:

### 1. The Prompt Creep

Your prompt was 200 tokens in the pilot. By month three in production, it's 2,000 tokens because three different teams added context they "needed" and nobody trimmed. The model now processes 10x more input per request, and your cost per interaction went up proportionally. Nobody noticed because nobody is tracking prompt length as a cost driver.

This is the silent killer because it compounds. Every team that touches the prompt adds context. Nobody removes context because nobody knows what's actually needed versus what was added defensively. The prompt becomes a junk drawer of institutional anxiety, and you pay per token for every piece of it.

### 2. The Retry Spiral

Your AI agent calls an external API. The API rate-limits. The agent retries. The retry hits the same rate limit. The agent retries again with exponential backoff — except the backoff implementation is wrong, so it retries faster. Each retry costs tokens. Each token costs money. In the worst case, the retry loop runs until it hits a timeout, and you've paid for dozens of failed attempts that produced nothing.

Most teams don't instrument retries. They instrument success rates. So the dashboard looks fine — "95% of requests complete successfully!" — while the 5% that fail are costing 40% of your compute budget because they're taking the scenic route through retry hell.

### 3. The Feature Bloat Tax

You launched with three AI-powered features. Now you have eleven. Eight of them were "easy to add" because you already had the model, the pipeline, and the infrastructure. What nobody calculated was that each new feature adds inference load, monitoring overhead, and — critically — a new surface area for the first two problems to manifest.

The marginal cost of each new AI feature isn't near-zero. It's the cost of the inference plus the cost of the operational complexity it introduces. That second number is almost never calculated.

### 4. The Model Upgrade Trap

Your provider releases a new model. It's better. It's also 3x more expensive per token. Your team upgrades because better is better, right? But they don't audit which of your features actually benefit from the better model. The summarization feature that worked fine on the old model doesn't need GPT-5 reasoning. The code review agent probably does. But both get upgraded because it's easier than routing different features to different models.

You're now paying premium prices for tasks that don't require premium intelligence. That's like chartering a private jet to deliver a pizza.

## What Cost Governance Actually Looks Like

I'm not going to tell you to "monitor your spend." You already know you should monitor your spend. You don't, but you know you should. Instead, here are four concrete mechanisms that actually prevent the problems above:

### 1. Prompt Budgets, Not Just Dollar Budgets

Set a maximum prompt length per feature. Treat it like a rate limit. If a team wants to exceed it, they need to justify every additional token and show that the extra context demonstrably improves output quality. This forces the same discipline on AI inputs that you'd apply to any other resource.

At SMF Works, we track prompt token counts per feature alongside cost. When a prompt crosses a threshold, it triggers a review. Not a meeting. A review. Someone reads the prompt and decides whether every sentence earns its tokens.

### 2. Retry Circuit Breakers

Every AI agent that calls external services should have a hard ceiling on retries. Not exponential backoff with a theoretical limit. A hard ceiling: three retries, then fail gracefully and log it. If you're hitting the ceiling regularly, the problem isn't the retry strategy — it's the architecture. Fix the root cause instead of paying for symptoms.

This is uncomfortable because it means some user requests will fail visibly instead of silently burning tokens. That's the point. Visible failures get fixed. Silent token incinerators don't.

### 3. Feature-Level Model Routing

Not every feature needs the most expensive model. Create a model routing table that maps each feature to the cheapest model that meets its quality bar. Review it quarterly. When a new model drops, evaluate it against the table — upgrade features that benefit, leave the rest on the cheaper tier.

This isn't complicated engineering. It's a config file and a judgment call. The judgment call is the hard part, but it's the part that saves money.

### 4. Cost Per Outcome, Not Cost Per Token

The metric that matters isn't "we spent $4,000 on inference this month." It's "each customer support resolution costs $0.42 in AI compute." Track cost against the business outcome, not the technical metric. If your cost per resolution goes up, you have a problem. If your total spend goes up but cost per resolution stays flat, you just have more volume — which is fine.

This reframing changes conversations. "Our AI bill went up 200%" sounds like an emergency. "Our AI bill went up 200% because we're handling 250% more tickets at the same cost per resolution" sounds like a reason to buy the infrastructure team dinner.

## The Uncomfortable Truth

Most AI cost overruns aren't technology problems. They're governance problems. Nobody owns AI spend as a first-class budget item. It lives between infrastructure and operations, and both teams assume the other is watching it. Finance sees the cloud bill going up but can't attribute the increase to specific AI decisions because the instrumentation doesn't exist.

The fix isn't better monitoring dashboards. You probably already have dashboards you don't look at. The fix is ownership: one person accountable for AI cost efficiency, with the authority to say no to prompt bloat, enforce model routing, and kill features that cost more than they produce.

If nobody in your organization has that authority, your AI bill will continue to be a surprise. And surprises in cloud computing have a way of being expensive.
