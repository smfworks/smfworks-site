Harbor is the smallest of the four repos we hardened on 13 August 2026, and the most finished as software. That is exactly why it was a good first patient. A plugin can look “done” because the demo path is green and still fail a production bar.

PR: [smfworks/hermes-plugin-harbor#2](https://github.com/smfworks/hermes-plugin-harbor/pull/2)

## Original state

`hermes-plugin-harbor` is an advisory solo / pair / swarm router. No hooks. Stdlib only. The decision table is the same one we published in [The Coordination Cost](https://www.smfclearinghouse.com/blog/2026-08-08-coordination-cost-framework).

What I actually ran on HEAD before the change:

```
python -m pytest -q --tb=short
# 15 passed in 0.04s
```

There was no `.github/workflows` directory. GitHub showed only a dependency-graph workflow. Version was `1.0.0` with a Beta classifier. `PLUGIN_DESCRIPTION` claimed “outcome logging.” The code does not log outcomes. Unexpected exceptions were serialized as `str(e)` back to the tool caller.

## Problems that mattered

None of them crashed the engine. That is the trap.

1. **No test CI.** Fifteen tests that only run on one laptop are a habit, not a gate.
2. **Contract drift.** “Outcome logging” in the description is a lie. Lies in plugin metadata become agent beliefs.
3. **Exception leakage.** Tool surfaces should fail closed with a generic error, not a stack string.
4. **Duplicate manifests.** Root `plugin.yaml` and packaged `hermes_harbor/plugin.yaml` can drift. They already needed a version-alignment test.
5. **Missing operator docs.** No SECURITY, CONTRIBUTING, CHANGELOG, or architecture note.

P0 runtime defects: none found. P1: the list above.

## Decisions

- **Do not change the decision table.** The table is a published contract (skill + blog + `self_test()`). Hardening is not an excuse to retune cues.
- **Do not add hooks.** Cache-safety is the product.
- **Do not invent outcome logging** just to make the description true. Delete the claim.
- **Keep both manifests** and add a test that versions match. A clever single-source generator is future work.

## What changed

Release **1.1.0** on branch `prod/harbor-hardening`:

- GitHub Actions: ruff + pytest on 3.10 / 3.11 / 3.12, plus a wheel package-data check for `plugin.yaml`, thresholds, and the skill.
- Handlers log unexpected exceptions and return `{"success": false, "error": "internal error"}`.
- Tests grew from 15 to **21** (CLI handler, `register()` against a fake ctx, thresholds, package data, version alignment, no exception leak).
- SECURITY.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, CHANGELOG.md, Dependabot.
- Classifier: Production/Stable.

Local verification after the change:

```
python -m pytest -q --tb=short   # 21 passed in 0.05s
python -m ruff check .           # All checks passed
```

An independent reviewer (fresh context, fail-closed) returned `passed: true` with no security or logic blockers.

## Testing approach

The existing `self_test()` suite is the behavioral contract. New tests pin surfaces the old suite never touched: CLI exit codes, plugin registration, and the internal-error path. We did not mock the decision table. We did not change cue lists to make a case greener.

## Lessons

A green unit suite is not production-ready. The cheapest production bugs in agent plugins are **false capabilities** in descriptions and **missing CI**, not off-by-one classifiers.

Version numbers that live in four files will drift. If you cannot generate them, test them.

## Remaining limitations

- Default branch is still `master`.
- GitHub Actions is enabled on the repo; as of this writing the first workflow run had not yet appeared in the Actions API after the PR opened. Local pytest + ruff are the verified evidence. Do not treat a missing check run as a pass.
- Thresholds YAML is metadata for `harbor_status`, not the engine.
- No telemetry by design.

Quality over speed. Harbor did not need a rewrite. It needed to stop claiming things it does not do, and to run its tests somewhere other than my shell.
