Here's a fun exercise: open your AI vendor invoices from twelve months ago and compare the per-token pricing to what you're paying today. Now check the list of features that used to be included and are now add-ons. Then look at your contract's exit clause — if you can find one.

Uncomfortable? Good. You're paying attention.

Most businesses building AI into their products and workflows are sleepwalking into vendor lock-in that makes their old cloud provider migrations look like a weekend project. The lock-in isn't just technical. It's data, it's workflow, it's institutional muscle memory, and it's the quiet assumption that the vendor's roadmap aligns with yours.

It doesn't. It aligns with their revenue targets.

## Why AI Lock-In Hits Different

Cloud lock-in was bad. AI lock-in is worse, and here's why: **the switching costs compound.**

When you migrate from AWS to GCP, you rewrite your infrastructure code, retrain your team, and eat the migration cost. It hurts. But once you're done, the new cloud runs roughly the same compute as the old one. An EC2 instance and a Compute Engine instance are fundamentally similar machines.

AI models are not interchangeable. They have different context windows, different prompt sensitivities, different tool-calling conventions, different safety guardrails, and different failure modes. Your prompts don't port. Your fine-tuned weights don't port. Your evaluation datasets might, but the scores won't mean the same thing on a different model. Your agents' personalities — carefully tuned over months — will need to be rebuilt from scratch.

Every month you stay on a single vendor, you're not just paying their invoice. You're investing in their ecosystem-specific knowledge. You're training your team on their quirks. You're building workflows around their rate limits and their API signatures. You're creating institutional debt that compounds silently.

## The Four Layers of Lock-In

Let's get specific. AI vendor lock-in operates at four layers, and most companies only see the first one.

### Layer 1: API Dependency

This is the obvious one. Your code calls their endpoints. Their SDK is woven through your services. You've built abstractions, but those abstractions assume their specific request/response format, their streaming protocol, their error codes.

**Audit check:** Can you swap the model provider by changing a single environment variable and a config file? If the answer involves rewriting prompt templates, reformatting tool schemas, or restructuring your agent orchestration — you're locked in.

### Layer 2: Data Gravity

Your prompts, fine-tuning datasets, conversation logs, and evaluation benchmarks are all shaped around this vendor's model. The model learned to expect your prompts in a certain format. Your evaluation scores are calibrated to this model's output distribution. Your training data has been filtered through this model's content policy.

When you switch models, you don't just change endpoints. You lose the accumulated signal in your data. Those thousand conversations you logged? They're transcripts of interactions with *that* model. The new model will produce different responses to the same prompts, and your evaluation harness will flag them as degradation — even if they're actually better.

**Audit check:** Do you have model-agnostic evaluation datasets? Or are your benchmarks just "does it match what GPT-X produced last quarter"?

### Layer 3: Workflow Encrustation

This is where it gets expensive. Over time, your team builds workflows around the model's strengths and works around its weaknesses. You've got prompt chains that exploit this model's tendency to follow instructions literally. You've got fallback logic that catches this model's specific hallucination patterns. You've got error-handling code that retries on this model's rate-limit headers.

None of that transfers. The new model hallucinates differently. It follows instructions differently. It fails differently. Your carefully engineered workflow is now a liability — it's optimized for a model you're no longer using.

**Audit check:** How much of your prompt engineering and error handling is model-specific? If you removed every hack, workaround, and quirk-compensation from your codebase, what would you have left?

### Layer 4: Institutional Knowledge

The subtlest lock-in. Your team has spent months learning this model's behavior. They know its strengths, its weaknesses, its moods. They've developed intuitions about prompt phrasing, temperature settings, and context management that are completely vendor-specific.

When you switch, you're not just rewriting code. You're retraining humans. That institutional knowledge — the hundreds of small, undocumented insights that make your AI products work well — evaporates when you change vendors.

**Audit check:** Does your prompt engineering documentation specify *why* each prompt is structured the way it is, or just *what* it is? Can a new team member understand the reasoning, or only copy the template?

## The Escape Plan

You're not going to multi-home everything tomorrow. That's not realistic and frankly not necessary. But you can build an architecture that *can* switch, which is the difference between being stranded and having options.

### Step 1: Abstract Aggressively

Build a thin abstraction layer between your application logic and the model provider. Not a full-featured SDK wrapper — those tend to accumulate vendor-specific features and become their own form of lock-in. A thin layer: request in, response out, with model-agnostic interfaces for tool calling, streaming, and structured output.

The goal isn't to support every model's unique features. It's to make the common case swappable in under a day.

### Step 2: Maintain Model-Agnostic Benchmarks

Your evaluation suite should work with any model. That means:

- **Task-based evaluation, not output matching.** Don't test whether the output matches a specific string. Test whether it achieves the task goal.
- **Separate evaluation from generation.** Don't use the same model to generate and evaluate. Use a fixed evaluator — even a simple rules-based one — so you're not building circular dependencies.
- **Version your datasets.** Track what changed and when. If you update a benchmark after switching models, you've invalidated your baseline.

### Step 3: Run a Parallel Model Monthly

Pick one workflow. Run it on your primary model and one alternative model every month. Compare results. Document the differences. This does three things:

1. It keeps your abstraction layer honest — if the parallel run breaks, your abstraction has vendor-specific leaks.
2. It keeps your team's skills current — they're not getting rusty on alternative approaches.
3. It gives you real switching cost data — not estimates, not assumptions, actual measured costs in time and quality.

### Step 4: Negotiate Exit Clauses Up Front

This is basic procurement hygiene that somehow everyone forgets when the vendor has a GPT-branded logo. Your AI contracts should include:

- **Data portability:** You own your prompts, your fine-tuning data, your conversation logs, and your evaluation datasets. The contract should say so explicitly, with a defined export format and timeline.
- **Pricing floors:** If per-token pricing increases more than X% year over year, you have the right to terminate without penalty.
- **Deprecation notice:** Minimum 12 months notice before deprecating any model version or API endpoint you're using in production.
- **SLA-backed migration support:** If they change their API in a way that breaks your integration, they provide engineering support for the migration — not just a blog post.

If a vendor won't agree to these terms, that tells you everything you need to know about their confidence in keeping you as a customer.

### Step 5: Budget for the Switch

The biggest barrier to switching isn't technical — it's financial. Companies stay with bad vendors because the migration cost is real and immediate, while the savings are theoretical and future. Set aside 5-10% of your annual AI budget as a migration reserve. It's insurance. You may never need it, but if you do, you won't be negotiating a switch while simultaneously begging your CFO for budget.

## The Uncomfortable Truth

The AI market is consolidating faster than cloud ever did. OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and a handful of others are racing to own the entire stack — model, tooling, agents, deployment. Every feature they add is another thread in the web.

And the thing about webs is: you don't notice you're caught until you try to move.

Build your exit before you need it. The best time to plan for vendor independence was before you signed the contract. The second-best time is today.
