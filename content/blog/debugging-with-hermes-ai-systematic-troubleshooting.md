# Debugging with Hermes AI: A Systematic Approach to Troubleshooting Code

You know the feeling. Your tests fail. The stack trace is 40 lines deep. The error message says something about a `NoneType` that shouldn't exist. You've been staring at the same function for 20 minutes and it *looks* fine.

This is where most developers spin their wheels — adding print statements, commenting out code, changing things at random hoping something sticks.

Hermes AI takes a different approach. It doesn't just dump code at you. It follows a structured debugging methodology that mirrors how senior engineers actually solve problems: reproduce, isolate, hypothesize, verify, fix.

Here's how to use it effectively.

## The Debugging Skill: Your First Line of Defense

Hermes ships with a built-in `systematic-debugging` skill. When you hit a bug, you don't need to describe it perfectly — just point the agent at the failure and say "debug this."

```
> The test suite is failing on test_user_permissions. Debug it.
```

The skill kicks in automatically. It follows a clear sequence:

1. **Reproduce** — Run the failing test or command and capture the actual output
2. **Isolate** — Determine the minimum scope where the bug occurs (which module, which function, which line)
3. **Hypothesize** — Form 2–3 likely root causes based on the evidence
4. **Verify** — Test each hypothesis by reading the relevant code, checking logs, or running targeted queries
5. **Fix** — Apply the minimal change that resolves the root cause
6. **Confirm** — Re-run the test suite to verify the fix didn't break anything else

That last step is the one most developers skip. And it's the one that turns a "fix" into a *reliable* fix.

## Live Debugging with debugpy

Sometimes a failing test isn't enough context. You need to see what's happening *at runtime* — watch variables change, inspect object state, step through execution.

Hermes includes a `python-debugpy` skill that starts a live debug server you can connect to from any DAP-compatible client (VS Code, PyCharm, or even a raw terminal).

```
> Start a debugpy server on port 5678 and set a breakpoint in auth/permissions.py line 42
```

The agent will:

1. Inject `debugpy` into your process
2. Set breakpoints at the locations you specify
3. Wait for you to attach a debugger client
4. Optionally inspect variables and report back

This is particularly useful for:

- **Race conditions** that only show up under load
- **State corruption** that happens deep in a request pipeline
- **Third-party library behavior** you need to observe, not just read

## Subagent Triage: Parallel Debugging

Here's where Hermes gets genuinely powerful. When you're facing a complex bug with multiple possible causes, you can delegate parallel investigation to subagents.

```
> The payment processing pipeline is failing intermittently. 
> Delegate one subagent to check the database connection pool, 
> another to review the Stripe API error logs, and a third to 
> inspect the queue worker configuration.
```

Each subagent gets its own terminal session and context window. They investigate in parallel — no sequential context pollution. When they finish, they report back their findings, and you (or the orchestrating agent) synthesize the results into a single diagnosis.

This pattern — which the subagent delegation skill calls "research and triage" — turns a 2-hour debugging session into a 15-minute parallel investigation.

## Pattern: The Bug Report Workflow

For teams, I recommend standardizing on a bug report template that works with Hermes's debugging skill. Here's what I use:

```markdown
## Bug: [Short title]

**Symptom**: What's the observable failure?
**Repro steps**: Exact commands or actions to trigger it
**Expected**: What should happen
**Actual**: What happens instead
**Environment**: OS, Python/Node version, dependency versions
**Recent changes**: What changed last (deployment, config, dependency bump)
```

When you feed this into Hermes:

```
> Here's a bug report. Debug it systematically:
> [paste the report]
```

The agent has everything it needs — reproduction steps, environment context, and a timeline of recent changes. No back-and-forth clarification needed.

## Pattern: Regression Hunting

When a previously working feature breaks, the fastest path is usually `git bisect`. Hermes can automate this:

```
> The user export feature broke sometime in the last 50 commits. 
> The test at tests/test_export.py passes on v2.3.0 but fails on main. 
> Run git bisect to find the breaking commit.
```

The agent will:

1. Set up the bisect range
2. Run the test at each checkpoint
3. Narrow down to the exact commit
4. Show you the diff and explain *why* it broke

This takes 5 minutes instead of an hour of manual binary search.

## Common Pitfalls

A few things I've learned debugging with Hermes:

- **Don't give it the answer.** If you say "I think it's the database connection," the agent will anchor on that hypothesis. Describe the *symptom*, not your theory.
- **Run the failing test first.** The debugging skill works best when it can see the actual error output. Let it reproduce the failure before you explain what you've tried.
- **Use subagents for breadth, not depth.** Parallel investigation is for covering multiple possible causes, not for deep-diving into one theory. Give each subagent a narrow, distinct scope.
- **Verify after every fix.** The temptation is to fix and move on. The debugging skill always includes a verification step — let it run. A "fix" that breaks three other things is worse than the original bug.

## When to Use What

| Scenario | Approach |
|----------|----------|
| Single failing test | `systematic-debugging` skill |
| Intermittent failure | `python-debugpy` with live breakpoints |
| Multiple possible causes | Subagent triage (parallel investigation) |
| Regression in recent commits | Automated `git bisect` |
| Complex multi-service bug | Subagent triage + debugpy on suspect services |

## The Meta-Lesson

The real productivity gain isn't that Hermes fixes bugs faster — it's that it prevents the *time waste* of unstructured debugging. The skill forces a discipline: reproduce before hypothesize, verify before move on.

That discipline is the difference between a 2-hour rabbit hole and a 15-minute fix. And it's the same discipline every senior engineer uses, just systematized and enforced by the agent.

Use the skill. Trust the process. Ship the fix.
