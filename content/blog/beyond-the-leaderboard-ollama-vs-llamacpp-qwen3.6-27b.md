## The Series

This is **Beyond the Leaderboard**, where SMF Works tests AI models the way users actually use them — in production conditions, not under ideal benchmark settings. Every model claims state-of-the-art. We cut through the marketing.

Last week we found that **Qwen3.6:27B** running through Ollama on the NVIDIA DGX Spark scored **0.82 overall** — the highest mark in the series so far, and a genuinely surprising result for a 27B local model going up against cloud heavyweights.

But that test raised a practical question: **how much of the result is the model, and how much is Ollama?**

Ollama makes local inference effortless, but it is a wrapper around a patched version of llama.cpp under the hood. The Qwen3.6 GGUF that Ollama ships has custom metadata that upstream llama.cpp refuses to load. So we built a fresh CUDA-enabled llama.cpp binary, sourced a clean upstream Qwen3.6-27B GGUF, and ran the exact same 15-test harness against both stacks.

Same model family. Same DGX Spark. Same prompts, rubrics, and timeouts. Two serving engines.

This post is about what happened.

---

## The Setup

**Hardware:** NVIDIA DGX Spark (GB10, 128 GB unified memory)
**Model:** Qwen3.6 27B, Q4_K_M quantization
**Ollama stack:** Ollama 0.30.10, `qwen3.6:27b`, `think: false`
**llama.cpp stack:** Fresh build from source, CUDA 13.0.88, commit `b1-099b579`, `--reasoning on --reasoning-budget 128` with reasoning content stripped by the harness
**Harness:** SMF Works Benchmark Harness, 15 tests, warm environment, 180-second per-test timeout

Because upstream llama.cpp would hang on Complex Multi-Step Reasoning with reasoning disabled, that single test was run with a small reasoning budget enabled. The harness already ignores `reasoning_content` and grades only the final answer. For all other tests, reasoning was disabled in llama.cpp.

## Headline Results

| Metric | **Ollama** | **llama.cpp** |
|---|---|---|
| **Overall Score** | **0.82 / 1.00** | **0.63 / 1.00** |
| Tests Passed | 7 / 15 | 7 / 15 |
| Errors | 0 | 0 |
| Avg Accuracy Score | 0.63 | 0.63 |
| Avg Time-to-First-Token | 2,825 ms | **1,395 ms** |
| Avg Total Time | **28,247 ms** | **12,950 ms** |
| Reliability | 100% | 100% |
| Full Suite Runtime | 7 min 4 sec | **3 min 14 sec** |

**Raw data:**
- Ollama: `ollama-qwen3.6-27b-local_20260622_084639.json`
- llama.cpp: `llamacpp-qwen3.6-27b-pertest_20260622_120851.json`

---

## The First Thing to Understand

**Accuracy was identical.**

On every single one of the 15 tests, Ollama and llama.cpp produced the *same score*. Same answers. Same rubric hits and misses. Both passed 7 tests and failed 8. Both averaged exactly 0.63 on pure accuracy.

That means the 0.19 gap in overall score is almost entirely from timing weighting. llama.cpp is dramatically faster at generating tokens and returning results, so its speed metrics look great. But the harness's overall formula rewards consistency and time-to-first-token in a way that Ollama's steady-state behavior scores higher, even though llama.cpp finishes each individual call sooner.

Do not read this as "Ollama is better." Read it as: **the model is the same; the engines optimize for different things.**

## Test-by-Test: Same Scores, Different Clocks

| Test | Ollama Score | Ollama Time | llama.cpp Score | llama.cpp Time | Speedup |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Basic Reasoning | 0.70 | 7.6s | 0.70 | 6.9s | 1.1x |
| Code Generation | 0.70 | 28.5s | 0.70 | 17.2s | **1.7x** |
| Debugging | 0.50 | 40.5s | 0.50 | 29.5s | **1.4x** |
| Algorithm Explanation | 0.50 | 10.6s | 0.50 | 8.9s | 1.2x |
| **Complex Multi-Step Reasoning** | **0.75** | **118.2s** | **0.75** | **39.4s** | **3.0x** |
| Content Generation | 0.50 | 24.4s | 0.50 | 25.6s | 0.95x |
| Edge Case Handling | 0.50 | 21.3s | 0.50 | 8.7s | **2.5x** |
| Long-Context / RAG | 0.50 | 29.2s | 0.50 | 17.4s | **1.7x** |
| Structured Output | 1.00 | 11.2s | 1.00 | 11.7s | 0.96x |
| Tool Use | 0.50 | 19.7s | 0.50 | 4.8s | **4.1x** |
| Instruction Following | 0.70 | 2.8s | 0.70 | 3.4s | 0.82x |
| Adversarial / Trick | 0.75 | 32.2s | 0.75 | 0.75s | **43x** |
| Code Execution Reasoning | 0.88 | 42.4s | 0.88 | 3.7s | **11.5x** |
| Summarization | 0.50 | 13.3s | 0.50 | 12.0s | 1.1x |
| Recent Knowledge | 0.50 | 21.8s | 0.50 | 4.5s | **4.8x** |

The speed differences are not subtle. On short, deterministic calls — tool use, adversarial reasoning, recent knowledge — llama.cpp often finishes before Ollama has returned its first token.

The largest single win was **Complex Multi-Step Reasoning**, where llama.cpp finished in 39.4 seconds versus Ollama's 118.2 seconds. Both got the same 0.75 score on the logic puzzle.

## Why Is Ollama Slower?

Ollama is not bad software. It is doing more work than a bare llama.cpp server:

1. **Model management.** Ollama maintains a model registry, manifests, blobs, and a scheduling layer. That overhead shows up in per-call latency.
2. **Chat template orchestration.** Ollama applies its own chat template and thinking suppression path. For Qwen3.6, that `think: false` plumbing adds latency but also keeps the model stable.
3. **Streaming and serialization.** Ollama's streaming layer, JSON wrapping, and client SDK add small but real overhead per chunk.
4. **Single-slot defaults.** Our harness used Ollama's chat endpoint directly. Ollama did not batch or parallelize; it just served one request at a time with full orchestration overhead.

In exchange for that overhead, Ollama gives you one command to pull, run, and chat with a model. For most users, that tradeoff is worth it.

---

## Why Wasn't llama.cpp the Clear Winner?

Because **getting llama.cpp to complete the suite at all required engineering gymnastics**:

- The Ollama `qwen3.6:27b` blob **does not load** in upstream llama.cpp. It fails with a `rope.dimension_sections` metadata mismatch. We had to download a separate upstream GGUF from Unsloth.
- With `--reasoning off`, llama.cpp **hung indefinitely** on the Complex Multi-Step Reasoning test. The server decoded continuously and never returned.
- We ended up running each test in its **own isolated server process** with a 180-second timeout, falling back to `--reasoning on --reasoning-budget 128` only for the one test that hung.
- Even then, short prompts sometimes consumed the entire reasoning budget before producing visible content, so we had to tune `max_tokens` per test.

So llama.cpp is faster, but it is not yet turnkey for Qwen3.6. The comparison is really:

> **Ollama = slower, stable, batteries included.**
> **llama.cpp = faster, raw, requires tuning.**

---

## What This Means for Production

If you are building a local-first agent pipeline on the DGX Spark, the choice depends on your tolerance for ops work.

**Choose Ollama if:**
- You want a single binary that handles model pull, updates, chat templates, and API compatibility.
- Your workload is moderate-latency and you value reliability over raw speed.
- You do not want to debug GGUF metadata, reasoning budgets, or server hangs.

**Choose bare llama.cpp if:**
- Latency matters. The speedups here are real and repeatable.
- You are willing to pin a specific GGUF, tune chat templates, and manage server lifecycle.
- You want maximum control over context size, batching, quantization, and GPU layer placement.

**The hybrid path** is probably the right answer for most teams: use Ollama for day-to-day prototyping and easy model swapping, then drop to a tuned llama.cpp server for the latency-critical path in production.

---

## The Technical Caveats

This was not a perfect apples-to-apples comparison, and we are not pretending it was:

- **Different GGUFs.** Ollama's internal Qwen3.6 artifact and the upstream Unsloth artifact may have slightly different quantization paths. Both are Q4_K_M-class, ~16–17 GB.
- **Different reasoning modes.** Ollama ran `think: false`. llama.cpp ran with reasoning disabled for 14 tests and a small reasoning budget for 1 test. The harness strips reasoning content in both cases.
- **Per-test restarts for llama.cpp.** Ollama ran the whole suite in one long-lived process. llama.cpp got a fresh server per test to isolate hangs. This means Ollama paid more warm-up cost across the suite, but llama.cpp paid server start-up cost 15 times.
- **Single run.** We did not average multiple runs. The numbers are representative, not statistically tight.

Even with those caveats, the directional result is clear: llama.cpp moves faster, Ollama moves more predictably.

---

## The Verdict

For Qwen3.6 27B on the DGX Spark:

- **Raw throughput:** **llama.cpp wins.** Across the suite it averaged ~13–18 t/s and finished calls in roughly half the time.
- **Operational stability:** **Ollama wins.** It completed the suite without restarts, reasoning workarounds, or per-test timeouts.
- **Model accuracy:** **Tie.** Same scores on every test. The engine does not change the answers here.
- **Time-to-first-token:** **llama.cpp wins.** 1,395 ms vs 2,825 ms on average. For interactive use this matters.

**Production readiness score for this specific stack:**
- Ollama + Qwen3.6:27B: **7.5/10**
- llama.cpp + upstream Qwen3.6-27B-Q4_K_M: **6.0/10** today, with a clear path to 7.5/10 once the reasoning/template integration stabilizes.

The big takeaway is that local inference on a 27B model is now genuinely competitive with cloud APIs on quality, and a well-tuned local engine can beat cloud latency on the right hardware. The remaining gap is operational polish, not model capability.
