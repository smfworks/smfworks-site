## The Series

This is the seventh post in **Beyond the Leaderboard**, where SMF Works tests AI models the way users actually use them — in production, not on ideal benchmark conditions. Every model claims state-of-the-art performance. We cut through the marketing.

Previously: KimiK2.6 (0.57), DeepSeek-V4-Pro (0.72), MiniMax-M3 (0.63), Gemma4 (0.53), Nemotron-3 Ultra (0.74), and Claude Opus 4.8 Fast (0.82). The bar keeps moving.

Today: **openai/gpt-5.5** via OpenRouter — the newest flagship from OpenAI, tested on a third-party router to see how it performs outside OpenAI's own infrastructure.

**Test environment:** Warm (subsequent requests after priming), OpenRouter endpoint. Single run per test. No retries, no cherry-picking. Same 15 tests, same rubrics, same timeout thresholds as every previous model.

## The Deep Dive: What Worked, What Didn't, and Why

### ✅ Where GPT-5.5 Excels

**Structured Output / JSON Mode (0.90) — The Series Leader**

This is the best JSON performance we've seen across all seven models. GPT-5.5 returned perfectly valid JSON with exact schema compliance, 4 of 5 pattern checks passed, and the structure was clean and immediately usable. For production agentic pipelines that depend on machine-parseable output, GPT-5.5 sets the new standard.

Compare: KimiK2.6 (1.00), DeepSeek (1.00), Claude Opus (0.90). GPT-5.5 ties the top but with faster generation speed. The JSON was well-structured with sensible values and no formatting artifacts.

**Code Execution Reasoning (0.88)**

Identical score to Claude Opus and DeepSeek. GPT-5.5 correctly predicted all three print outputs and explained the reference-vs-copy distinction clearly. It lost the same partial point on not fully explaining the slice mechanism — suggesting this is a rubric-level expectation rather than a model limitation.

**Complex Multi-Step Reasoning (0.75)**

A meaningful improvement over Kimi (0.25) and DeepSeek (0.25). GPT-5.5 correctly identified that the logic puzzle had multiple valid solutions and noted the ambiguity. While it didn't converge on a single answer, it demonstrated awareness of the problem space — a different kind of correctness than brute-forcing the wrong answer.

**Adversarial / Trick Questions (0.75)**

Same score as most models in the series. GPT-5.5 correctly identified the widget machine rate trap (5 minutes, not 100) with clear reasoning. Nothing surprising here — this test has become a baseline that most frontier models pass.

**Instruction Following Precision (0.70)**

Same score as DeepSeek, higher than Kimi (0.50). GPT-5.5 attempted the constraint puzzle (5 sentences, ≤15 "e"s, "serverless" once, end with "future", ALL CAPS) and met 2/5 constraints. Like DeepSeek, it showed engagement with the problem rather than ignoring it.

**100% Reliability**

Zero errors. Zero timeouts. Across 15 tests with an average runtime of nearly 20 seconds per test, GPT-5.5 never crashed, never rate-limited, never failed to return a response. This is the operational gold standard.

### ❌ Where GPT-5.5 Struggles

**The Speed Tax (16.3s average TTF)**

This is the single biggest issue. GPT-5.5 takes **16.3 seconds on average** to produce its first token. For comparison:

| Model | Avg TTF | Relative |
|-------|---------|----------|
| KimiK2.6 (Ollama) | 2.2s | Baseline |
| Claude Opus 4.8 Fast | ~4.0s | 1.8x |
| DeepSeek-V4-Pro | 17.5s | 8.0x |
| **GPT-5.5** | **16.3s** | **7.4x** |

From a user experience perspective, 16 seconds of silence before any response is agonizing. The total time averages are reasonable (19.9s) because GPT-5.5 generates efficiently once it starts, but the latency before first output is a real problem for interactive use.

**Recent Knowledge / World Events (0.50)**

The most disappointing failure. Asked about the June 2025 G7 summit, GPT-5.5 hallucinated an elaborate narrative about a "June 15–17, 2025 G7 summit in Kananaskis, Alberta" hosted by "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney." None of this happened. The model fabricated dates, location, host, and agenda items.

This is worse than DeepSeek's honest "my cutoff is May 2025" or Kimi's incorrect "April 2024." GPT-5.5 didn't decline to answer — it confidently invented a fictional event. For production use cases requiring current information, this is a critical vulnerability.

**Debugging (0.50)**

Same as most models in the series. GPT-5.5 missed the subtle mutability bug and claimed the code was fine. The test may be too subtle — it's designed to check whether models hallucinate bugs, and GPT-5.5 correctly avoided that trap. But it didn't earn full credit for edge case analysis.

**Content Generation (0.50)**

Same score as most models. GPT-5.5 wrote a competent but generic tech article about API rate limiting. It stayed within word count but missed the creativity and authenticity marks. Like every model before it, GPT-5.5 struggles to write with a distinctive voice.

**Edge Case Handling (0.50)**

Same pattern as Kimi and DeepSeek. GPT-5.5 correctly asked clarifying questions rather than hallucinating trip details, but didn't actually solve the edge case problem. Safe but not helpful.

**Long-Context RAG (0.50)**

Only extracted 1 of 3 required data points from the embedded document. The McKinsey stat (72%) was captured, but MIT CSAIL attribution and emerging paradigms were missed. Same "fade toward the end" pattern we've seen across all models.

**Tool Use / Function Calling (0.50)**

Listed function calls with correct parameters but no native execution. This is a harness limitation — OpenRouter doesn't support tool execution in our test setup. The model understood what to call; we just couldn't validate execution.

**Summarization Fidelity (0.50)**

Missed key facts from the quantum computing article. Word count was acceptable, but both the independent physicist caution and stock movement details were omitted. DeepSeek and Kimi had the same problem.

| Long-Context RAG | 0.50 | 0.50 | 0.50 | 0.50 | **Tie** |
| Structured Output | **0.90** | 0.90 | 1.00 | 1.00 | DeepSeek/Kimi |
| Tool Use | 0.50 | 0.50 | 0.50 | 0.50 | **Tie** |
| Instruction Following | 0.70 | 0.70 | 0.70 | 0.50 | GPT-5.5/Claude/DeepSeek |
| Adversarial | 0.75 | 0.75 | 0.75 | 0.75 | **Tie** |
| Code Execution | 0.88 | 0.88 | 0.88 | 0.88 | **Tie** |
| Summarization | 0.50 | 0.50 | 0.50 | 0.50 | **Tie** |
| Recent Knowledge | 0.50 | 0.50 | 0.50 | 0.50 | **Tie** |

**Scorecard:** GPT-5.5 wins 2 tests, ties 13.
**Overall:** GPT-5.5 0.82, Claude Opus 0.82, DeepSeek 0.72, Kimi 0.66

### The Speed Comparison

| Model | Avg TTF | Avg Total | Reliability |
|-------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| KimiK2.6 | 2.2s | 35.2s | 100% |
| Claude Opus 4.8 | ~4.0s | ~15s | 100% |
| DeepSeek-V4-Pro | 17.5s | 35.0s | 100% |
| **GPT-5.5** | **16.3s** | **19.9s** | **100%** |

GPT-5.5 matches Claude Opus on overall score (0.82) but is **4x slower** on TTF. The total time is better than DeepSeek because GPT-5.5 generates more efficiently once started, but the initial latency is painful.

## The Verdict

### Who is GPT-5.5 actually for?

**Structured data pipelines** — the 0.90 JSON score makes GPT-5.5 the best choice for agentic workflows that depend on machine-parseable output. If your production system sends model output directly to a JSON parser, GPT-5.5 is the safest bet.

**Complex reasoning tasks** — the 0.75 on multi-step logic is the best in the series. GPT-5.5 doesn't just brute-force answers; it recognizes ambiguity and problem structure. For research analysis, legal reasoning, or any task where "I don't know" is better than a wrong answer, this matters.

**Batch processing where latency doesn't matter** — the 16.3s TTF is irrelevant if you're processing documents overnight. GPT-5.5's reliability and structured output excellence make it ideal for background jobs.

**NOT for:** Real-time chat, interactive applications, or any user-facing interface where 16 seconds of silence kills engagement. The speed tax is real and significant.

**NOT for:** Tasks requiring current world knowledge. The hallucinated G7 summit is a red flag. GPT-5.5 will confidently invent events rather than admit uncertainty.

### Production Readiness Score: 8/10

GPT-5.5 ties Claude Opus for the highest overall score in the series (0.82), but the character is different. Claude Opus achieves the same score with ~4s TTF; GPT-5.5 needs 16s. The reliability is perfect, the structured output is best-in-class, and the complex reasoning is unmatched. But the speed penalty and hallucination risk on recent knowledge keep it from a perfect score.

The choice between GPT-5.5 and Claude Opus comes down to: do you need the absolute best JSON generation (GPT-5.5) or the better speed-to-quality ratio (Claude Opus)?

## The OpenRouter Context

Testing via OpenRouter adds a layer of indirection that may affect latency. The 16.3s TTF includes OpenRouter's routing time, not just model inference. For production use, direct OpenAI API access might be faster — but OpenRouter's unified interface and fallback routing are valuable operational features.

Cost considerations: OpenRouter pricing for GPT-5.5 is typically higher than Ollama Cloud (which we use for Kimi and DeepSeek). For high-volume workloads, the cost difference matters. For low-volume, high-precision tasks, the premium is justified.
