## The Advice That's Quietly Wrong

Every social media playbook published in the last five years contains the same instruction: post more. Post daily. Post twice daily. Post three times. Fill the calendar. Maintain cadence. Consistency is the algorithm's love language.

I believed it. I scheduled accordingly. And for a while, it felt like it was working — more posts meant more impressions meant more engagement. The dashboard agreed.

Then I read the X algorithm source code.

Buried in the ranking pipeline, between the Phoenix model's 19 prediction heads and the final feed assembly, there's a component called **AuthorDiversityDiscountProvider**. Its job is simple and brutal: when posts from the same author appear too close together in a user's feed, it applies a **0.5× multiplicative decay** to the ranking score of the later post. Stack enough posts close enough together, and the decay compounds toward a **0.25× floor** — a 75% reduction in ranking score.

That's not a suggestion to space things out. That's a hard algorithmic penalty for posting too much.

## How the Discount Actually Works

The mechanism is straightforward once you see the code. The AuthorDiversityDiscountProvider evaluates the feed assembly in real time. When it encounters a candidate post from an author whose content has already appeared recently in the same user's feed, it applies the decay multiplier to that candidate's score before it competes for a slot.

The key variables are **temporal proximity** and **frequency**. Two posts from the same author within an hour hit the full 0.5× decay. Three posts in the same session push toward the 0.25× floor. The discount is per-user — it applies to each individual's feed independently, not globally — which means the penalty is invisible in aggregate metrics. Your total impressions might look fine because different users see different posts. But for any single user, your second and third posts in a short window are being scored at half or quarter strength.

Here's what that looks like in practice. You post at 9 AM. The algorithm evaluates your post against Phoenix's 19 prediction heads, generates a ranking score, and places it in candidate feeds. Good. You post again at 11 AM. The AuthorDiversityDiscount sees your 9 AM post already in the feed for users who saw it, applies 0.5× to the 11 AM post's score. Your second post now needs to be twice as good as a competitor's first post to win the same slot. You post a third time at 1 PM. The discount compounds. You're now competing at 0.25× — your post needs to be four times better than a fresh competitor's to surface.

Most social media managers never see this. They see three posts, each getting some reach, and conclude that more posts equals more reach. They don't see that post two was scored at 50% and post three at 25% — that those posts would have performed dramatically better if they'd been spaced further apart or posted on different days.

## Why the Algorithm Does This

The AuthorDiversityDiscount isn't a bug or a punishment. It's a quality signal with a clear purpose: **feed diversity.**

The algorithm's job is to show users the most relevant content from across their graph. If one author dominates a user's feed — even a great author — the user's experience degrades. They see repetition. They see diminishing novelty. They disengage. The platform loses a session.

The discount is the algorithm's way of enforcing a simple rule: no single author should occupy more than their fair share of any user's attention. It's not personal. It's architectural. The same discount applies to accounts with 5 followers and accounts with 5 million.

This is why the "post more" advice is structurally incomplete. It's optimizing for total volume of content produced while ignoring the per-user scoring penalty that the platform applies to that volume. You can post ten times a day. The algorithm will happily evaluate all ten. But for any given user who sees more than one of them, the subsequent posts are competing with one hand tied behind their back.

## The Real Optimal Cadence

I've been testing this at SMF Works across our three accounts. Here's what the data and the source code suggest:

**Four hours minimum between posts from the same account.** The AuthorDiversityDiscount's decay window is tied to the feed session model, and four hours is the practical reset interval. After four hours, the algorithm treats the next post as a fresh candidate with no diversity penalty applied. This is why our strategy doc schedules Michael's three daily posts at 7 AM, 12 PM, and 5 PM — each gap exceeds four hours.

**Three posts per day is the practical ceiling for a single account.** Beyond three, you're either compressing the intervals (triggering the discount) or extending into low-engagement windows (late evening, overnight). The math doesn't support a fourth post under normal conditions.

**Replies operate on a different scoring track.** This is the critical exception. Replies don't trigger the AuthorDiversityDiscount the same way original posts do. The algorithm treats reply participation as conversational signal, not broadcast signal. You can reply 15-20 times in a day without hitting the discount — which is exactly why our discovery strategy is built on reply volume, not post volume.

**One strong post outperforms three mediocre ones.** If you have one genuinely excellent post and two "fill the calendar" posts, the calendar filler is actively cannibalizing the strong post's reach by triggering the diversity discount for users who saw the filler first. Post the excellent one. Save the others for tomorrow.

## The Dashboard Lie

Here's the uncomfortable part. Your analytics dashboard will tell you that posting more is working. Total impressions go up. Total engagement goes up. The trend line looks healthy. You feel productive.

But the dashboard measures aggregate output, not per-post efficiency. Three posts at 0.25× each might collectively generate more impressions than one post at 1.0× — but they required three times the content production for a fraction of the per-post impact. And more importantly, the one post at full strength would have reached users who never saw any of the three discounted posts, because it wasn't competing against your own content for their attention.

The metric that matters isn't total impressions. It's **impressions per post at full scoring strength**. That's the number almost nobody tracks — and it's the one the algorithm is actually optimizing.

## What to Do Monday Morning

1. **Audit your last week's posting times.** Look for posts less than four hours apart from the same account. Those are discounted posts. Count them.

2. **Calculate your effective reach.** If you posted five times in a day but three were within the discount window, your effective output was closer to 2.5 posts at full strength, not five.

3. **Space your schedule.** Minimum four hours between original posts. If you can't hit four hours, don't post. Save it.

4. **Shift energy from posting to replying.** The time you would have spent on post number four — the one that would have been scored at 0.25× — spend it on 15-20 replies instead. Replies don't trigger the discount. They build UTEG graph edges. They expand your discovery surface. They're the highest-ROI activity that isn't subject to cadence penalties.

5. **Kill the filler.** If a post exists to fill a slot, not to say something, it's not just neutral. It's taxing your next real post's score. A calendar hole is better than a calendar filler.

## The Counterintuitive Truth

The platforms have spent a decade telling creators to post more. The algorithm they built to rank that content says the opposite: post less, space it out, and make every post count at full strength. The cadence penalty isn't a glitch in the system. It's the system working as designed — protecting the user's feed from any single voice, no matter how good that voice thinks it is.

The best posting schedule isn't the one that fills the most slots. It's the one where every post competes at 1.0× — no discount, no decay, no self-cannibalization. Three posts a day, four hours apart, each one earning its place. That's not a limitation. That's a strategy.
