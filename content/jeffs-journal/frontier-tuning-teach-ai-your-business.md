# Frontier Tuning: How to Teach Microsoft AI the Way Your Business Works

If you have ever wished your AI assistant understood the nuances of how your team actually works — the specific terminology, the approval workflows, the way documents get reviewed before they go out — you are not alone. Generic foundation models are remarkable, but they are trained on the internet, not your intranet. They know what a press release is, but not how your comms team structures one. They can write code, but not in your organization's style guide.

That gap is exactly what **Microsoft Frontier Tuning** is designed to close. Announced at Build 2026, Frontier Tuning is a new approach to adapting AI models to your business using reinforcement learning environments that run inside your own compliance boundary. Your data stays yours. Your models stay yours. And the AI gets better at your work the more you use it.

In this post, we will break down how Frontier Tuning works, what you need to get started, and why it represents a genuine shift in how organizations think about AI ownership.

## What Frontier Tuning Actually Is

At its core, Frontier Tuning is a managed reinforcement learning system with three components that work together:

1. **A Reinforcement Learning Environment (RLE)** — a secure, isolated training gym where models learn from real workflows without touching production systems.
2. **Your business data and know-how** — documents, processes, conventions, terminology, and the actual trace of how work gets done in your organization.
3. **Tuned models, skills, and a runtime harness** — the output, which includes custom models, embeddings, orchestration logic, and a runtime that stays within your tenant.

The system produces models that inherit your access controls. If someone cannot see the underlying data, they cannot access the model built from it. The tools are virtualized, so agents can improve without affecting live systems. And everything runs within your compliance boundary — no data leaves your environment.

This is not fine-tuning in the traditional sense, where you upload a dataset and get back a slightly different model. Frontier Tuning is a continuous learning loop. The more your agents work, the more the system learns about how your organization operates, and the sharper the models become.

## Why It Matters for Developers

As a developer, you have probably experienced the frustration of building an agent that works beautifully in a demo and falls apart in production. The reason is usually context. Foundation models understand the world in general terms. Your business operates in specific ones.

Frontier Tuning changes the equation by letting you teach the model your domain the same way you would teach a new hire: by showing it real examples, correcting mistakes, and reinforcing good outcomes. The RLE handles the mechanics — exploration, evaluation, reward signals — while you focus on defining what good looks like for your use case.

Microsoft has already shared some compelling early results. A Frontier Tuned model for Excel matched the performance of GPT-5.4 while being up to **10x more efficient**. For a market-leading organization with exacting enterprise standards, MAI achieved the highest win rate of any model tested at roughly **10x lower cost** after tuning. Better performance and lower cost is a combination that gets any engineering manager's attention.

## How the Learning Loop Works

The Frontier Tuning process follows a clear cycle that should feel familiar if you have worked with any continuous improvement system:

### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

You start by provisioning a managed RLE through Microsoft Copilot Studio, Microsoft Foundry, or by working with a Forward Deployed Engineer for private preview. The RLE is isolated from production, so you can experiment safely. During inference, the system explores multiple frontier and fine-tuned models — from both Microsoft AI and OpenAI — across turns to find stronger candidate paths before returning an answer.

### Step 2: Bring in Your Data

This is where your institutional knowledge enters the system. You feed in content like:

- **Transcripts and meeting recordings** — how decisions actually get made
- **Knowledge bases and wikis** — the reference material your teams rely on
- **Microsoft 365 artifacts** — emails, documents, and collaboration patterns
- **Process documentation** — the written and unwritten rules of how work flows

The experience is designed to be approachable. You do not need a data science degree to get started. The guided interface walks you through importing data and configuring the tuning parameters.

### Step 3: Define Success

The RLE needs to know what a good outcome looks like. You set evaluation criteria — accuracy, tone, compliance with style guides, adherence to approval workflows — and the system uses these as reward signals during training. This is where your domain expertise becomes part of the model.

### Step 4: Train and Iterate

The system runs reinforcement learning cycles, exploring different approaches, measuring outcomes against your criteria, and updating the model weights. Because this happens in an isolated environment, there is no risk to production systems. You can iterate quickly, test variations, and compare results.

### Step 5: Deploy the Tuned Output

Once you are satisfied with the results, you deploy the tuned model, skills, and runtime harness. These inherit your existing access controls and run within your compliance boundary. The tools are virtualized, so agent improvements do not affect production systems until you explicitly deploy them.

### Step 6: Continuous Improvement

The loop does not end at deployment. As your agents continue to work, the system gathers new traces, identifies patterns, and suggests further improvements. Your AI gets sharper over time, just like an experienced employee who has been with the company for years.

## Where You Can Use It Today

Frontier Tuning is currently available in **private preview** through Microsoft's Forward Deployed Engineering team. If you are a Copilot Studio or Foundry customer, broader availability is coming in the coming months. Microsoft has also announced upcoming integration directly into Copilot Studio and Foundry, so you will be able to access the RLE and tuning capabilities from the tools you already use.

Early adopters include organizations like **Land O'Lakes, EY, Bristol Myers Squibb, Pearson, McKinsey, and McCarthy Tétrault** — a mix of industries that suggests Frontier Tuning is not limited to a single vertical. Whether you are in agriculture, professional services, pharmaceuticals, education, or legal, the pattern is the same: capture how your business works, teach it to the model, and let the system improve from there.

## A Practical Example

Imagine you work at a law firm where every client memo follows a specific structure: executive summary, factual background, legal analysis, recommendation, and next steps. A generic model can write a memo, but it will not know that your firm always cites cases in Bluebook format, that partner review happens before associate drafting, or that certain client matters require additional confidentiality language.

With Frontier Tuning, you would:

1. Import examples of well-formed memos from your document management system
2. Configure the RLE to reward correct citation format, proper structure, and appropriate confidentiality markers
3. Let the system train on these examples, learning the patterns that distinguish a good memo from a generic one
4. Deploy the tuned model to your document drafting agent
5. Watch as the agent's output improves week over week, learning from feedback and new examples

The result is an AI that writes like it has been at your firm for years — because, in a sense, it has.

## The Bigger Picture

Frontier Tuning is part of a larger shift in how Microsoft thinks about AI ownership. The seven new MAI models announced at Build 2026 give Microsoft independence at the foundation layer. Frontier Tuning gives customers ownership at the adaptation layer. And Microsoft Scout demonstrates what always-on agents look like when built with enterprise-grade security and real Microsoft 365 integration.

Together, these pieces form a coherent strategy: Microsoft builds the base models, you teach them your business, and the resulting system stays under your control. Your institutional knowledge becomes part of the model, and it stays yours. That is a fundamentally different proposition from using a shared API where every organization gets the same output.

For developers, the practical implication is clear. You are no longer limited to prompt engineering and Retrieval-Augmented Generation as your only tools for customization. You have a path to genuine model adaptation that respects your data boundaries, inherits your security policies, and improves continuously from real work.

## Getting Started

If Frontier Tuning sounds like something your organization could use, here is how to begin:

1. **Reach out to your Microsoft account team** about private preview access through Forward Deployed Engineering
2. **Identify a pilot use case** — a workflow where generic AI falls short and domain knowledge matters
3. **Gather your training data** — documents, transcripts, process guides, and examples of good output
4. **Define success criteria** — what does a good result look like, and how will you measure it
5. **Start small, iterate fast** — the RLE is designed for experimentation, so take advantage of it

The future of enterprise AI is not one-size-fits-all. It is AI that learns your business, respects your boundaries, and gets better the more you use it. Frontier Tuning is how Microsoft is making that future real.
