If you build software for a living and you haven't looked at Microsoft's agent development toolchain since 2025, you're in for a surprise. In the last six months, Microsoft has shipped a complete, end-to-end stack for building AI agents — from local development to cloud deployment to enterprise governance. It's not a collection of disconnected APIs anymore. It's a platform.

Here's what you need to know about each piece, when to use which, and how they fit together.

## Microsoft Agent Framework v1.0: The Foundation

The single biggest development is the **Microsoft Agent Framework hitting v1.0**. This is the open-source SDK that unifies Semantic Kernel and AutoGen into one stable framework. If you were building agents on either of those before, there's now a clear migration path — and a single destination.

What v1.0 includes:

- **Multi-model and multi-platform support** — Azure OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, Amazon Bedrock, and Ollama all work through the same API surface
- **Programmatic and declarative workflows** — chain agents together in code, or define multi-step pipelines in configuration
- **First-class Foundry integration** — memory, hosted agents, observability (tracing, monitoring, evaluations), and Foundry Tools as native building blocks
- **Open standards** — MCP, A2A, and OpenAPI all supported out of the box

The developer experience feels clean. Here's what booting up an agent looks like in Python:

```python
from agent_framework.azure import AzureOpenAIResponsesClient
from azure.identity import AzureCliCredential

agent = AzureOpenAIResponsesClient(
    credential=AzureCliCredential(),
).as_agent(
    name="SupportTriageBot",
    instructions="You are an expert support triage agent.",
)

response = await agent.run("Analyze this ticket and classify its priority.")
print(response.text)
```

It's simple enough to prototype in minutes, with enough depth underneath to push to production.

## Foundry Toolkit for VS Code: Your Agent IDE

Alongside the Framework v1.0, **Foundry Toolkit for VS Code** is now generally available. Think of it as what the Azure Functions extension did for serverless — but for agents.

From inside VS Code, you can:

- **Create agents from templates** or scaffold them with GitHub Copilot
- **Test and debug locally** with full execution visualization and traces
- **Deploy to Foundry Agent Service** without leaving the editor
- **Inspect telemetry** — see what your agent did, what tools it called, where it spent time

The local-to-cloud loop is now measured in keystrokes, not hours. For developers used to building REST APIs and microservices, this is a familiar and comfortable workflow. Your agent is just another deployable artifact — with better debugging.

## Agent Skills in Visual Studio: Teaching Copilot Your Team's Way

This one deserves attention even though it's not about building standalone agents. **Agent Skills** in Visual Studio let you teach Copilot how your specific team works — and these skills are reusable instruction sets that activate automatically when they're relevant.

The concept is elegant: define a skill once in a `SKILL.md` file (following the agentskills.io specification), and Copilot loads it dynamically whenever the context matches. Unlike custom instructions that apply to every interaction, skills are task-specific and context-aware.

Here's the difference:

| | Custom Instructions | Agent Skills |
|---|---|---|
| **Scope** | Always active | Activated per-task |
| **Best for** | Coding style, conventions | Workflows, templates, multi-step procedures |
| **Structure** | Single markdown file | Directory with SKILL.md + supporting files |

A practical example: you create a `code-review` skill that includes your team's checklist, preferred comment format, and the severity levels you use. Whenever you ask Copilot to review code, it automatically applies that skill — no prompting required.

Skills live in your repo (`.github/skills/`, `.claude/skills/`, `.agents/skills/`) or your user profile (`~/.copilot/skills/`). They're auto-discovered. The .NET team at Microsoft has published a set of [example skills](https://github.com/dotnet/skills) that show the pattern.

This matters for teams because it means tribal knowledge — "this is how we do pull requests," "here's our SQL naming convention" — can be encoded once and applied automatically. New developers get the benefit immediately without having to learn it from a wiki page they'll never read.

## Copilot Studio: Agents for Business Users

Where Agent Framework is for developers building from code, **Copilot Studio** is the low-code platform for building business-facing AI agents inside Microsoft 365.

In 2026, Copilot Studio has matured significantly. You can now:

- **Build agents with knowledge sources** — point them at SharePoint document libraries, websites, or uploaded files
- **Define topics and triggers** — create structured conversation flows for common business scenarios
- **Add actions via Power Automate** — connect to hundreds of connectors including Salesforce, ServiceNow, and Jira
- **Deploy to Microsoft Teams** — make your agent available in the sidebar, group chats, and channels
- **Use the Agent Builder** — a simplified experience inside M365 Copilot for building quick-use agents without leaving Teams

The key insight with Copilot Studio is that it's designed for the people who understand the business process — not the developers. A customer success manager who knows exactly what questions clients ask can build a support triage agent in an afternoon. That's the shift: agent development is becoming a business capability, not just an engineering one.

## Foundry Agent Service: Running Agents in Production

Once your agent is built, **Foundry Agent Service** handles production deployment. It's a managed runtime that takes your Agent Framework agents and runs them with:

- **Automatic scaling** — no thinking about containers or instances
- **Built-in observability** — tracing, monitoring, and evaluation dashboards in Foundry Control Plane
- **Memory service (preview)** — persistent context across sessions
- **Toolbox (preview)** — managed tool registry for giving agents access to the right capabilities
- **Enterprise governance** — role-based access, audit logging, data residency controls

For teams deploying agents that handle real business operations, the production concerns are non-negotiable. Foundry Agent Service addresses the hard parts — reliability, observability, and compliance — that separate a weekend prototype from something you trust with customer data.

## The Complete Picture: Which Tool When?

Here's how I think about the decision tree:

| If you are... | Start with... |
|---|---|
| A developer building a custom agent with code | **Microsoft Agent Framework + Foundry Toolkit** |
| A VS user wanting Copilot to match team practices | **Agent Skills in Visual Studio** |
| A business analyst automating a workflow | **Copilot Studio** |
| A dev deploying to production | **Foundry Agent Service** |
| An IT admin deploying agents org-wide | **Copilot Studio agents → Teams** |

But the real power comes from using them together. An engineering team can build the core agent logic in Agent Framework, deploy it to Foundry Agent Service, and then expose it through Copilot Studio as a business-facing agent available in Teams. The business users customize the interaction flow. The developers own the runtime. Both sides operate in their natural tools.

## Why This Stack Matters

Microsoft is doing something here that's worth noticing: they're not just building a chatbot API. They're building an **agent platform** — a complete developer, business, and operations experience for building AI agents end-to-end.

The open-source SDK (Agent Framework) means you're not locked into any one model provider. The VS Code integration means your local development loop is fast. Copilot Studio bridges technical and non-technical users. And Foundry Agent Service handles the production concerns that most agent startups are still figuring out.

For developers in the Microsoft ecosystem, the message is clear: the tools are here. The framework is stable. The deployment story exists. It's time to build.
