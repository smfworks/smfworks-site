Microsoft Build 2026 changed the stakes for Windows users. OpenClaw 2026.6.1 ships with native Windows support, a dedicated Windows Hub companion app, and 1.6 billion Windows devices now potential OpenClaw nodes. If you have been waiting to run your own AI agent on the machine you already use, the wait is over.

The challenge is no longer whether OpenClaw works on Windows. It does. The challenge is choosing the right setup path and avoiding the traps that still trip people up.

## The recommended path: Windows Hub

OpenClaw now offers a native **Windows Hub** app for Windows 10 20H2 and Windows 11. This is the fastest way to get running because it bundles setup, system tray status, chat, diagnostics, and Windows node capabilities into a single signed installer.

Download the installer from the latest OpenClaw release:

- [OpenClawCompanion-Setup-x64.exe](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/releases/latest/download/OpenClawCompanion-Setup-x64.exe)
- [OpenClawCompanion-Setup-arm64.exe](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/releases/latest/download/OpenClawCompanion-Setup-arm64.exe)
- [Checksums](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/releases/latest/download/OpenClawCompanion-SHA256SUMS.txt)

Run the installer. It does not require administrator privileges. When you first launch **OpenClaw Companion**, it opens setup and asks how you want to connect to a Gateway. Choose **Set up locally** for the simplest path. This provisions an app-owned `OpenClawGateway` WSL distro behind the scenes, installs the Gateway inside it, and pairs the app automatically. Your existing Ubuntu or other WSL distros are left alone.

When the tray icon turns green, open **Command Center** to confirm connection, pairing, and node status.

## CLI-first option: PowerShell installer

If you prefer the terminal and want the Gateway directly on Windows without the companion app, use the PowerShell installer:

```powershell
iwr -useb https://openclaw.ai/install.ps1 | iex
```

This detects Windows, installs Node if needed, installs OpenClaw, and launches onboarding. To skip onboarding, run:

```powershell
& ([scriptblock]::Create((iwr -useb https://openclaw.ai/install.ps1))) -NoOnboard
```

After install, run `openclaw onboard --install-daemon` to register the Gateway as a service. This path is ideal if you plan to run headless, remote, or SSH-tunneled setups.

## When to still choose WSL2 directly

WSL2 remains the most Linux-compatible Gateway runtime. Consider it if:

- You already run your development environment inside WSL2 and want the Gateway there.
- You need Linux-specific dependencies or toolchains that are not yet native on Windows.
- You are comfortable managing the Gateway manually and want full control.

For most Windows users, Windows Hub handles the WSL complexity automatically and is the better starting point.

## What you get after setup

Once connected, Windows Hub exposes the full OpenClaw experience:

- **Native chat window** plus the browser-based Control UI.
- **System tray status** and launch-at-login.
- **Windows node mode** for agent-controlled screen snapshots, notifications, text-to-speech, speech-to-text, camera and microphone access with opt-in, device status, and controlled `system.run`.
- **Local MCP server** so Claude Desktop, Claude Code, or Cursor can drive Windows capabilities through OpenClaw.
- **Command Center diagnostics** for sessions, usage, channels, nodes, pairing, and repair commands.

Pairing a node may require approval from the Gateway host. If the app shows a pairing request, approve it with:

```powershell
openclaw devices list
openclaw devices approve <request-id>
openclaw nodes status
```

## Common pitfalls and how to avoid them

The Windows launch has been mostly smooth, but a few patterns keep appearing in community reports:

1. **Gateway connection confusion.** If you already have a WSL Gateway or a remote Gateway, use **Advanced setup** or the Connections tab instead of the local setup path. Point the app at the right endpoint.

2. **PATH and command-not-found errors.** After the PowerShell install, close and reopen your terminal so the refreshed PATH takes effect. The Windows Hub app does not depend on PATH because it ships self-contained.

3. **WSL version mismatch.** The Hub provisions its own WSL distro. If you are running a hybrid setup with a separate WSL Gateway, make sure that distro is updated separately.

4. **Privacy-sensitive commands blocked.** Commands like `screen.record`, `camera.snap`, and `camera.clip` require explicit opt-in through `gateway.nodes.allowCommands`. This is intentional, not a bug.

5. **Insider builds for Scout and MXC.** Some enterprise features, such as the always-on Scout agent and Microsoft Execution Containers (MXC), require specific Windows builds, GitHub Business, and Microsoft 365 Copilot accounts today. That will broaden over time, but home users should start with Windows Hub, not Scout.

## The security story

One of the most compelling demos at Build was the MXC sandbox. An OpenClaw agent was asked to delete all files on a desktop. It kept trying. MXC blocked it. That is the point: agent capability is only as useful as the sandbox that constrains it. On Windows, policy-driven containers give you a way to let agents act without letting them run wild.

For everyday use, Windows Hub gives you a controlled surface area. Sensitive commands require opt-in, the Gateway enforces policy, and the app-owned WSL distro is isolated from your main system.

## Bottom line

If you have a Windows PC and want to run OpenClaw, the simplest path is:

1. Download **Windows Hub** from the latest OpenClaw release.
2. Launch it and choose **Set up locally**.
3. Wait for the tray icon to turn green.
4. Open Command Center and start using your agent.

You do not need to become a WSL expert first. You do not need to choose between platforms. OpenClaw on Windows is now a first-class experience, and the companion app is the right front door.
