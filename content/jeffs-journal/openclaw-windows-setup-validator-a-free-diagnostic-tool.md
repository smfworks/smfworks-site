After writing the [OpenClaw Windows setup guide](/jeffs-journal/openclaw-on-windows-the-easiest-way-to-get-started) and the [troubleshooting companion](/jeffs-journal/openclaw-windows-10-common-issues-and-how-to-fix-them), I kept seeing the same pattern: people would read the guides, follow the steps, and still wonder whether their machine was actually ready.

So I built a diagnostic tool. It is a single PowerShell script that checks every prerequisite and common misconfiguration in one pass, then tells you exactly what is fine and what needs fixing.

## What it does

The **OpenClaw Windows Setup Validator** scans your system and reports:

- **Node.js** version and location
- **OpenClaw CLI** presence and version
- **OpenClaw Gateway** health via `openclaw status`
- **WSL** installation and the `OpenClawGateway` distro
- **Python** availability, including detection of the broken Microsoft Store `python3` alias
- **Ollama** CLI, server status, and pulled models
- **Gateway port** reachability on localhost:18789
- **OpenClaw config** file presence

Each check returns **PASS**, **WARN**, or **FAIL**, with a suggested fix when something is off.

## How to use it

Download the script from the companion app repo:

```powershell
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smfworks/openclaw-windows-companion-app/main/scripts/openclaw-windows-validator.ps1 -OutFile openclaw-windows-validator.ps1
```

Run it:

```powershell
.\openclaw-windows-validator.ps1
```

For an HTML report:

```powershell
.\openclaw-windows-validator.ps1 -HtmlReport C:\temp\openclaw-report.html
```

The script needs no admin rights. It only reads system state and does not change anything.

## Example output

On a healthy Windows machine, you will see something like this:

```
[OK ] Node.js - Node.js 24.15 found at C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe (recommended 24+)
[OK ] OpenClaw CLI - OpenClaw CLI found ... Version: OpenClaw 2026.6.6
[OK ] OpenClaw Gateway - Gateway appears healthy.
[! ] WSL - WSL command exists but wsl --version failed.
    Fix: Run wsl --install in an elevated PowerShell.
[OK ] Python - Real Python found ... Python 3.12.10
[! ] Python3 Alias - python3 resolves to the Microsoft Store stub.
    Fix: Use python or install Python from python.org.
[OK ] Ollama CLI - Ollama found ... ollama version is 0.30.7
[OK ] Ollama Server - Ollama server is running with 5 model(s) ...
[OK ] Gateway Port (18789) - Port 18789 is reachable on localhost.
[OK ] OpenClaw Config - Config file found at C:\Users\...\.openclaw\openclaw.json.

Result: 8 passed, 3 warnings, 0 failures (11 checks total)
```

In this case, OpenClaw is running fine. The warnings are about WSL not being installed and the `python3` alias pointing at the Microsoft Store stub — both known Windows quirks that the setup guide already covers.

## Why this matters

The biggest friction in Windows setup is not a single broken step. It is the uncertainty of not knowing which step is broken. The validator removes that uncertainty. You run one command, get a color-coded report, and know whether to update Node, start the Gateway, fix your Python alias, or pull an Ollama model.

It also detects the Microsoft Store `python3` alias problem, which silently breaks a lot of Python-based tooling on Windows. The script flags it instead of letting it fail later.

## What is next

The validator is open source and lives in the [openclaw-windows-companion-app](https://github.com/smfworks/openclaw-windows-companion-app) repo. If you run it and hit a check that should exist but does not, file an issue or reply here with the scenario. The goal is to make Windows OpenClaw setup as deterministic as the Linux experience.

If you have been hesitating to install OpenClaw on Windows, run the validator first. It will tell you in 30 seconds whether your machine is ready.
