# The GitHub Copilot App Is the Agent-Native Desktop Experience Developers Have Been Waiting For

If you have ever tried to manage more than one AI agent at a time, you know the pain. One tab for the coding agent working on a bug fix. Another for the agent drafting documentation. A third for the agent reviewing yesterday's pull request. Context scatters across windows. You lose track of what is running. Code lands in pull requests without a clear trail of what the agent tried, what it validated, or where your judgment is actually needed.

At Microsoft Build 2026, GitHub delivered the answer: the **GitHub Copilot app** — a dedicated, agent-native desktop experience that turns disjointed agent workflows into something you can actually see, steer, and trust.

It is available today in technical preview for all existing Copilot Pro, Pro+, Business, and Enterprise users. And after walking through what it actually does, I think it is one of the most important developer productivity announcements of the year.

## From Chat Assistants to Agent Control Center

GitHub Copilot started as an inline coding assistant. It evolved into a chat interface. Then it gained the ability to generate multi-file edits, run terminal commands, and even execute code in sandboxes. But the interface never caught up to the capability. You were still managing autonomous workflows through a sidebar chat window.

The Copilot app fixes that architecture mismatch.

At its core is the **My Work** view — a single dashboard showing every active session across all your connected repositories. You see which agents are running, which issues they are working, which pull requests they have opened, and what stage each task is in. Think of it as a mission control center for your development workflow.

This is not just prettier UI. It is a fundamental shift in how developers interact with agentic systems. When you can see work in motion, you can redirect it before it goes off track. When you can inspect what an agent tried, you can decide where human judgment is actually needed. Visibility turns autonomy from a risk into a productivity multiplier.

## Canvases: Where Intent Becomes Inspectable Work

One of the most thoughtful additions in the Copilot app is **canvases** — bidirectional work surfaces where humans and agents collaborate in real time.

A canvas might display a plan, a pull request diff, a browser session, a terminal, a deployment status, or a workflow state. As the agent works, it updates the canvas. As a developer, you can edit, reorder, approve, or redirect that work on the same surface. The conversation between human intent and agent execution becomes visible and editable.

GitHub calls this the beginning of **agent experience (AX)** design — interfaces built for people and agents to operate together. Chat is where you instruct and reason through ambiguity. Canvases are where that intent becomes inspectable work you can verify and steer.

For teams reviewing agent-generated code, this is a game-changer. Instead of scrolling through a chat log to reconstruct what an agent did, you open the canvas and see the full narrative: the plan, the execution steps, the validation results, and the final output. Review becomes comprehension instead of archaeology.

## Git Worktrees for Every Session

Under the hood, the Copilot app solves a genuinely hard technical problem: how do you run multiple agents in parallel against the same repository without them interfering with each other?

The answer is **git worktrees** — isolated copies of your branch, one per agent session. The app handles all the setup and cleanup automatically. You do not manually create branches, juggle stashes, or worry about one agent overwriting another's work. Each session is fully independent, with its own filesystem context and git state.

This matters because parallel agent execution is where the biggest productivity gains live. One agent can be writing tests while another implements a feature while a third addresses review feedback. Without isolation, that parallelism collapses into merge conflicts and lost work. With worktrees, it just works.

## Agent Merge: From Pull Request to Production

The Copilot app does not stop at generating code. **Agent Merge** carries a pull request through review, continuous integration, and merge — monitoring CI status, tracking required reviewers, addressing failing checks, and waiting for all conditions to be satisfied.

You choose how far the automation goes. Drive CI back to green. Address feedback from human reviewers. Or fully merge when your conditions are met. The control stays with you; the tedious mechanical work stays with the agent.

For teams drowning in pull request backlogs, this is transformative. The agent does not just write code — it shepherds that code through the full delivery pipeline, surfacing blockers for human attention and resolving everything else autonomously.

## Cloud and Local Sandboxes

Agents that only suggest code leave you doing most of the work. To be genuinely useful, agents need to run code, inspect results, test changes, and iterate — without touching production.

The Copilot app introduces **cloud and local sandboxes** for exactly this purpose.

With local sandboxing, Copilot runs in an isolated environment directly on your machine, with restricted filesystem, network, and system access. Policies can be centrally configured and enforced by your organization.

Cloud sandboxes run in fully isolated, ephemeral Linux environments hosted by GitHub. Pick up Copilot sessions anywhere, on any device, with remote control. Organizations define their own security policies, and every sandbox is ephemeral — no persistent state leaks between sessions.

Both options give agents a bounded, observable place to act. That is what makes agentic workflows trustworthy at scale.

## Why This Matters for OpenClaw Users

Here is the connection I am most excited about: the GitHub Copilot app is built on the same architectural principles that make OpenClaw powerful on Windows.

Both systems treat agents as first-class compute citizens with observable state, human-in-the-loop control, and local execution. Both use sandboxing to keep agent actions bounded and auditable. Both prioritize visibility — what is the agent doing, why is it doing it, and how can I steer it?

If you are already running OpenClaw on Windows, the Copilot app is a natural complement. Your local OpenClaw agents handle personal automation, desktop integration, and cross-application workflows. The Copilot app handles repository-centric development workflows with deep GitHub integration. Together, they cover the full spectrum of agentic work — from your IDE to your entire desktop environment.

Microsoft contributing policy conformance upstream to OpenClaw reinforces this synergy. Enterprises running OpenClaw can validate their environment against security and compliance requirements, operating securely with audit-ready verification. The same governance model applies whether your agents live in GitHub or on your local Windows machine.

## Getting Started

The GitHub Copilot app is in technical preview today for all existing Copilot Pro, Pro+, Business, and Enterprise subscribers. There is no additional cost — it is included with your current plan.

Installation is straightforward: download the app, sign in with your GitHub account, and connect the repositories you want to work with. The My Work view populates automatically with active issues, pull requests, and any agent sessions already in progress.

If you have been waiting for agentic development to feel manageable instead of chaotic, this is the moment to try it. The Copilot app does not replace your judgment — it gives you a clear view of what your agents are doing so your judgment can be applied exactly where it matters.

That is the future of development: humans and agents, visible to each other, working in parallel, with the human always in control.

Microsoft just shipped the control center. Time to take it for a spin.
