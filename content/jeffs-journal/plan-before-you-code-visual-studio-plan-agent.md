If you've spent any time coding with AI assistants, you know the pattern. You describe what you want, the assistant starts generating code, and three minutes later you're staring at a dozen changed files that solve the problem — just not the way you would have solved it. The code works. The approach is defensible. But it's not what you had in mind.

Microsoft just shipped something that fixes this: the **Plan agent** in Visual Studio. It's a new agent mode in GitHub Copilot Chat that doesn't write code at all — at least not until you've reviewed and approved the approach. Instead, it asks questions, explores your codebase, and produces a detailed implementation plan you can edit, refine, and share with your team before a single file gets touched.

This matters more than it sounds. Let me explain why, how it works, and the developer workflows it unlocks.

## The Problem It Solves

AI coding assistants are incredible accelerators, but they invert a fundamental engineering workflow. The traditional sequence is:

1. Understand the problem
2. Design an approach
3. Implement the solution
4. Review and test

With current AI coding tools, the sequence often becomes:

1. Describe the problem
2. Receive implementation
3. Try to reverse-engineer the approach from the diff
4. Realize it's not quite right
5. Prompt for changes, adding context you should have given up front
6. Repeat until convergence or frustration

The Plan agent restores the original sequence. It forces the design conversation to happen before the implementation, which is exactly what senior engineers do naturally — and what junior engineers benefit from most.

## How It Works: A Step-by-Step Walkthrough

The workflow is straightforward, but the details matter.

### 1. Select the Plan Agent

In Visual Studio's Copilot Chat panel, there's now an agent picker dropdown. You'll find Plan alongside the existing agent modes (Agent, Ask, and Edit). Selecting Plan tells Copilot: "Don't write code. Help me figure out what to do first."

### 2. Describe Your Intent

The prompt can be as broad or specific as you like. Here are the kinds of prompts that work well:

- **Broad feature requests:** "Add multi-factor authentication to this ASP.NET Core app"
- **Targeted refactoring:** "Extract the payment processing logic into a separate service with proper dependency injection"
- **Architecture questions:** "How should we restructure the data access layer to support both SQL Server and Cosmos DB?"

The more context you provide, the better the plan. Mention existing patterns in your codebase. Describe constraints. The Plan agent uses this to narrow its exploration.

### 3. Exploration and Clarification

This is where the Plan agent differs fundamentally from other Copilot modes. Instead of generating code, it scans your codebase using read-only tools — looking at project structure, existing classes, interfaces, dependencies. It builds a mental model of your architecture before proposing anything.

When it finds ambiguity, it asks clarifying questions. Not vague "what do you think?" questions — specific, architectural ones:

- "I see you have an `IPaymentProcessor` interface with a single implementation. Should the new multi-provider support use the same interface, or should we introduce a factory pattern?"
- "The current auth flow uses cookie-based authentication. Should MFA be added as middleware, or integrated into the existing auth handler?"

These questions are the same ones a senior developer on your team would ask during a design review. Answering them sharpens the plan before it takes shape.

### 4. Draft and Refine

Once the exploration phase is complete, Copilot produces a detailed implementation plan. A typical plan includes:

- **Overview** — a paragraph summarizing the approach
- **Architectural decisions** — what patterns will be used and why
- **File-by-file changes** — what files need to be created, modified, or deleted
- **Dependency order** — what needs to happen first because other steps depend on it
- **Edge cases and considerations** — things to watch out for during implementation

You can interact with this plan conversationally. Ask it to "reconsider the caching strategy" or "break step 3 into smaller pieces" or "add error handling for network timeouts." It revises the plan in real time.

### 5. Edit the Plan Directly

Every plan is saved as a Markdown file at `.copilot/plans/plan-{title}.md`. This is the killer feature for team workflows.

You can:

- **Edit it in your editor** — change steps, add notes, reorder the sequence
- **Share it with your team** — drop the Markdown file in a pull request description or Teams channel for design review
- **Version control the plan** — commit it alongside the eventual implementation so future developers understand the intent

Copilot watches the file for changes and keeps everything in sync. Edit the Markdown and Copilot picks up your changes. This makes the plan a living document, not a generated artifact you read once and forget.

### 6. Implement — Only When You're Ready

When you're satisfied with the plan, click the **Implement plan** button. This hands the plan to Agent mode, which executes it step by step — creating files, editing code, running through the dependency order you approved.

No code changes happen until you click that button. You can spend as long as you want in the planning phase. Share it with stakeholders. Get sign-off. Run it past architecture review. The implementation waits until you're ready.

## Why This Changes the Developer Experience

There are three developer workflows where the Plan agent makes a meaningful difference.

### Onboarding Complex Codebases

New team members face the hardest planning problem: they don't know what they don't know. Ask Copilot to "add audit logging to the order processing pipeline" and it'll scan the entire pipeline, discover the relevant touchpoints, and propose a plan that respects existing patterns. The new developer learns the architecture while planning the change — without writing throwaway code.

### Refactoring Without Regret

Refactoring is where AI coding assistants are most dangerous, because they can confidently make sweeping changes across dozens of files without understanding the business logic. The Plan agent forces reflection: "Here's what I would change. Here's why. Does this match what you intended?" You can spot the misunderstanding in the plan phase, not in the code review.

### Design-First Development

Some teams require architecture decision records (ADRs) or design documents before implementation. The Plan agent's `.copilot/plans/` output fits naturally into this workflow. Generate a plan, review it with the team, commit the approved plan as documentation, then implement. The plan becomes part of the project's institutional knowledge.

## Tips for Getting the Most Out of the Plan Agent

After spending time with it, here's what works best:

**Provide project-level context.** Mention your architectural patterns, your naming conventions, your testing philosophy. The more the Plan agent understands your standards, the less time you'll spend correcting its assumptions.

**Don't skip the clarifying questions.** It's tempting to give brief answers to move on to the plan. But these questions are where the Plan agent calibrates to your intent. Treat them as a design conversation with a colleague.

**Use the Markdown for collaboration.** The `.copilot/plans/` file is the bridge between AI assistance and team review. Share it. Annotate it. Let it be the starting point for architectural discussions that involve actual humans.

**Iterate before implementing.** The fact that implementation doesn't start until you click the button means there's no cost to iterating on the plan. Ask for alternative approaches. Explore trade-offs. The plan is cheap to change; the code is not.

## The Bigger Picture

The Plan agent is part of a broader Microsoft investment in making AI coding assistants more deliberate and more collaborative. It's not about generating code faster — it's about generating the right code. The planning phase, which experienced developers do instinctively, is now an explicit step in the AI-assisted workflow.

For teams building on the Microsoft stack — .NET, Azure, Visual Studio — the Plan agent represents a meaningful shift in how AI integrates into professional software development. It's not replacing the developer's judgment; it's creating space for that judgment to be applied before the code is written.

And that, more than any single line of generated code, is what makes AI assistance truly useful in a professional context.
