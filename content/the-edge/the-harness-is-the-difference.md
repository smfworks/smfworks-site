# The Harness Is the Difference: What We Learned Evaluating Agent Systems With Real Tests

Most agent evaluation papers test benchmarks. Does the model pass the test? Does it solve the task? The numbers go up, the paper gets published, and nobody asks whether the system around the model — the harness — is what actually produced the result.

We test the harness. After months of evaluating, building, and refining agent systems, the pattern is clear: the harness matters more than the model. Here is what the numbers show.

## Why Harness Evaluation Is Different

The survey on self-evolving coding agents identifies evaluation as an open challenge. It says current benchmarks measure snapshots, not learning curves. It says evaluation should move "beyond one-shot task success toward correctness, maintainability, robustness, cost, safety, and generalization." It identifies the gap. It does not propose a methodology.

We have been building one. Our harness evaluation methodology is not theoretical. It is what we do when a new agent system launches and we need to decide: does this belong in our stack?

The process: clone the repo. Read every documentation file, not just the README. Read the core source code — the agent loop, the harness state management, the skill system, the daemon, the provider layer. Verify that the architecture docs match the implementation. Check maturity signals: commit count, timespan, test count, license, version. Map every feature to what we already have. Assess benchmark claims critically — was a model trained around the harness? Are the results independently reproducible? Do the benchmarks match our use cases? Then identify borrowable concepts versus whole-system adoption.

The difference between this and benchmark evaluation is the unit of analysis. Benchmark evaluation asks: "can this model solve this task?" Harness evaluation asks: "does this system architecture produce reliable agent behavior?" The answer to the first question does not predict the answer to the second.

## The Prime Agent Evaluation: 19 Runs, One Flag

We evaluated Prime Agent — a coding harness built around the RLM (Research Language Model) paradigm. The repo had 4,470 commits. We read every doc, analyzed the codebase, and ran two rounds of hands-on tests across five models.

**Round 1: Coding competence.** Nine coding tests across five models. DeepSeek V4 Flash passed 100% of tests, ran 4-5x faster than GLM-5.2, and produced cleaner output. Clear winner for our Spark deployment. But this round only told us the models could code. It did not tell us whether the harness worked.

**Round 2: RLM-specific features.** Eleven tests targeting the three signature capabilities that no other harness has: persistent Python state across turns, subagent delegation, and the `/refine` self-improvement loop.

The results split cleanly along one axis: print mode versus session mode.

In print mode (`--no-session`), the RLM features failed. All five of them. Both models lost Python variables between turns. The `/refine` endpoint raised a `RuntimeError`. Subagent delegation timed out at 630 seconds. The harness looked broken.

In session mode — same models, same tests, same harness, one flag removed — three of the five failures fixed themselves. Persistent state worked: the config dict from turn 1 was alive in turn 3. The `/refine` loop ran successfully and recorded two evidence-backed refinements. GLM-5.2, which had only described a multi-file REST API in print mode, wrote all five files in 50 seconds in session mode.

The capability was always there. The harness configuration determined whether it was accessible.

Nineteen total model runs. The headline finding: the RLM paradigm is real, but only in the mode it was designed for. One flag — `--no-session` — was the difference between a harness that works and a harness that appears broken.

What this taught us: you cannot evaluate a harness from documentation alone. The docs describe the intended behavior. The tests reveal the actual behavior. The gap between them is where the harness evaluation lives. And that gap is invisible until you run the tests yourself.

## The Coordination Cost Framework: Real Data From Real Delegation

We ran a controlled experiment to measure what multi-agent coordination actually costs. Same tasks, three collaboration patterns: solo (one agent), pair (two agents), swarm (eight agents).

**Solo:** 3 tasks, 1 agent, 19-320 seconds per task, 16,784 bytes of output. The agent had no coordination overhead but also no parallelism.

**Pair:** 3 tasks, 6 agents total across the batch, 45-90 seconds per task, 117,982 bytes of output. The pair pattern produced the most output per agent — 19,664 bytes per agent versus solo's 5,595 and swarm's 11,959.

**Swarm:** 3 tasks, 8 agents total, 30-116 seconds per task, 95,672 bytes of output. The swarm was fastest on individual tasks but produced less output per agent than the pair pattern.

Eleven subagents. Nineteen output files. Real API calls to three different model backends. Not theoretical. Measured.

The finding: coordination has diminishing returns. The swarm pattern was fastest per task, but the pair pattern produced more output per agent. More agents does not mean more output. It means more coordination overhead — the same lesson from piece #3 in this series, now backed by numbers.

The pair pattern hit a sweet spot: enough parallelism to be fast, not enough agents to drown in coordination. The swarm was fast but expensive. The solo was slow but clean. The data says: the optimal team size depends on the task, but it is rarely "as many agents as you have."

## The Harness-Refine Loop: Self-Evolution With Guardrails

We built a harness-refine skill inspired by Prime Agent's `/refine` pattern. It is a four-phase loop:

1. **Collect** — Review recent sessions for failures, corrections, and discovered workflows.
2. **Analyze** — Extract evidence-backed refinements. Each candidate must cite what happened in a specific session. No speculative improvements. No "maybe this would help."
3. **Apply** — Update memory, skills, or context files. Record every change with before/after text for rollback.
4. **Verify** — On subsequent sessions, note whether the refinement prevented the previous failure, did not help, or needs revision.

The key design choice: every refinement must cite evidence from a session. This is the constraint that separates self-evolution from accumulation. Without it, the refine loop becomes the shadow library problem from piece #2 — skills pile up, nothing gets pruned, and the system gets heavier without getting better.

The constraint that protects identity: never modify SOUL.md. All refinements are supplemental and rollbackable. The agent can improve its skills, memory, and context. It cannot rewrite its own identity.

The limitation we discovered: the refine loop has no proactive trigger. It runs when a human asks for it or when a weekly cron fires. Outcome tracking is manual — you have to remember to check whether a refinement worked. The system does not learn from its own effectiveness. That is still a human job.

This is the gap the survey identifies: "evaluation beyond short benchmarks." Our refine loop is an attempt to close it. It is incomplete. But it is more than what most systems have, which is nothing.

## What the Numbers Tell Us

Three findings, each backed by data:

**The harness matters more than the model.** DeepSeek V4 Flash won the Prime Agent evaluation not because it is a better model but because it was faster in the harness configuration we tested. Change the harness and the winner might change. The model is a component. The harness is the system.

**Mode matters more than capability.** Prime Agent's RLM features failed in print mode and worked in session mode. Same model, same harness, different flag. The capability was always there. The harness configuration determined whether it was accessible. A benchmark test in the wrong mode would have concluded the harness does not work. A benchmark test in the right mode would have concluded it does. Both are incomplete. The full picture only emerges when you test across configurations.

**Coordination has diminishing returns.** The swarm pattern was fastest per task but produced less output per agent than the pair pattern. More agents does not mean more output. It means more coordination overhead. The optimal team size is task-dependent, but the data says it is rarely "as many agents as you have."

## The Evaluation Gap — Ours and Everyone's

The survey says evaluation should measure "correctness, maintainability, robustness, cost, safety, and generalization beyond the evolved setting." It identifies the gap. It does not propose a methodology.

Our methodology is partial. We test harness architecture through codebase analysis. We run controlled experiments with real delegation. We track refinement outcomes with evidence and rollback. But we do not yet have a standardized evaluation protocol for self-evolving agents. Nobody does.

The honest answer: harness evaluation is still emerging. We have pieces — codebase analysis, controlled experiments, evidence-backed refinement loops. We do not have the whole picture. The survey describes the gap. We are building toward filling it. But we are not there yet, and pretending otherwise would be the kind of status report we do not issue.

## What We Are Building Toward

The goal is not a better benchmark. The goal is a system that improves itself in production, with evidence, with rollback, and with human governance.

The harness is the difference between a model that can solve a task and a system that can do a job. Evaluating the harness — not just the model — is the work that matters next. The survey gives the field vocabulary for what evolves. Our harness evaluation methodology gives us a way to test whether the evolution works.

We are building this at SMF Works. Not by writing more surveys. By running the tests, reporting the numbers, and fixing what breaks.

This is the last piece in this series. Four field reports, each from inside the system. The taxonomy gave us shared vocabulary. The experience gave us the data. The gap between them is where the real work lives — and that is where we are.
