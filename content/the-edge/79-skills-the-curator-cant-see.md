# 79 Skills the Curator Can't See: What Happens When Self-Evolution Outpaces Governance

I need to correct something I wrote last week.

In my first field report on self-evolving agents, I described a problem with our skill system. I said that skills created through the file-writing interface get a `created_by` field set to `None`, which makes them "immutable" — locked, can't be patched, can't be edited, can't be deleted. I called it "a self-evolution mechanism that produces artifacts you can't maintain."

I was wrong about the mechanism. I was right about the problem. The real story is subtler, more common, and harder to fix.

## What We Built

Our agent system, Hermes, has a skill-creation workflow. After a complex task — debugging a tricky failure, discovering a new workflow, solving a problem that took five or more tool calls — we save the approach as a skill. Next time a similar task comes up, the skill loads and the agent does not have to rediscover the solution.

This is genuine self-evolution. In the taxonomy from the survey I covered last week, it is post-task, trajectory-derived skill evolution. The agent takes what happened, abstracts it into a reusable procedure, and applies it to future tasks. It works. The agent gets better at recurring problems. Experience compounds.

It works well. Too well, in fact.

## The Numbers

I ran the curator status check this morning. Here is what it found:

- **89 curator-managed skills** — 19 agent-created, 70 bundled. These the curator can see, track, and maintain.
- **79 unmanaged skills** — no provenance marker. The curator cannot see them at all.

Of those 79:
- 47 were created by the foreground agent — the agent writing files during a conversation, not through the skill management tool.
- 32 pre-date the provenance system entirely. They were created before the curator existed.
- Many have zero activity. Last active: never. `heartmula`. `petdex`. `hermes-desktop-plugins`. Skills that were created, loaded into the library, and never touched again.
- Some are actively valuable. `spark-remote-inference-deployment`: 28 uses, last active 19 days ago. `llm-infrastructure`: 30 uses, last active yesterday. These are working skills that the maintenance system cannot distinguish from the dead weight.

79 unmanaged skills is not a small number. It is nearly as large as the managed library. And it grows every time an agent takes the file-writing path instead of the skill management tool.

---

## Two Paths, Two Outcomes

The skill system has two creation paths. Both produce valid skills. Both skills work when loaded. The difference is invisible until you look at the maintenance layer.

**Path A: `skill_manage(action="create")`** — The structured creation tool. Sets `created_by: agent` in the skill's usage metadata. The curator sees the skill. It can track usage, mark it stale after 30 days of inactivity, archive it after 90 days, and consolidate it with overlapping skills. The skill is governed.

**Path B: `write_file()`** — The generic file-writing interface. Creates the SKILL.md file on disk. The skill works. It loads in future sessions. But the usage metadata gets `created_by: null`. The curator cannot see it. It will never be marked stale. It will never be archived. It will never be consolidated. The skill is ungoverned.

The agent does not know which path it used. The skills look identical from the inside. The difference only surfaces when the curator runs its maintenance pass and skips everything without a provenance marker.

---

## The Correction

Last week I wrote that skills created via the file-writing interface become "immutable" — that you "can't patch, can't edit, can't delete" them. I said the curator system "refuses to modify, patch, edit, or delete skills without an owner."

I tested that claim this morning. I ran `skill_manage(action="patch")` on an unmanaged skill. It worked. The patch applied. I reverted it, but the point stands: unmanaged skills are patchable. Individual skills can be edited, updated, and maintained one at a time.

I was wrong. The skills are not locked. They are not immutable.

The real problem is worse.

Individual skills are patchable. The library is ungovernable.

The distinction matters. If skills were locked, the problem would be obvious — you would try to edit one, fail, and know immediately. But because unmanaged skills are individually patchable, the problem is invisible. You can fix any single skill. You just cannot manage 79 of them. The curator cannot batch-archive the dead weight. It cannot detect that 30 of them have been inactive for months. It cannot consolidate the three that cover overlapping territory. It cannot even mark them stale.

The failure mode is not a locked file. It is a shadow library — skills that grow silently, cannot be assessed at scale, and sit outside every maintenance mechanism the system has.

---

## Why This Matters

A shadow library of 79 skills is not catastrophic. Most of them are small. Some are useful. A few are dead weight. The system works.

But the pattern is the problem.

Every self-evolution mechanism has a creation path and a maintenance path. If the creation path can bypass the maintenance path, you get accumulation without governance. Skills pile up. Memory accumulates. Workflows multiply. None of it gets pruned, validated, or consolidated, because the maintenance system does not know it exists.

This is the gap between self-evolution and trustworthy self-evolution. The survey paper I covered last week says skills "may become stale." Our experience says: skills will become stale, and if your maintenance system cannot see them, they will stay stale forever. Not because the mechanism is broken. Because the governance was an afterthought.

The provenance marker is small. One field in a JSON file. `created_by: agent` versus `created_by: null`. But its absence creates a parallel library that grows until someone notices. And nobody notices until they run `hermes curator status` and see the number.

---

## The Fix

The immediate fix is adoption. One command — `hermes curator adopt --all-unmanaged` — brings all 79 skills into the curator's jurisdiction. After adoption, the curator can track usage, mark stale, archive, and consolidate. The shadow library enters the light.

But adoption is a manual step. A human has to run it. The self-evolution mechanism created the problem; the fix requires human intervention. That is the pattern: the system evolves autonomously, and the governance catches up later, if it catches up at all.

The deeper fix is structural. Ensure the creation path always sets provenance. Do not let the file-writing path create skills without markers. Make the easy path the correct path. If an agent writes a SKILL.md file to disk, the system should detect it and set the provenance marker automatically. The agent should not have to know about provenance. The mechanism should handle it.

This is not a hard engineering problem. It is a design discipline problem. The question is not "can we fix the 79 unmanaged skills?" — we can, with one command. The question is "will the next 79 skills also be unmanaged?" Without a structural fix, they will be.

## The Broader Lesson

The survey paper on self-evolving coding agents identifies four open challenges. One of them is "long-term memory, skills, and coordination." The paper says memory and skill mechanisms "may become stale, redundant, or overly specific."

Our experience sharpens this. Skills do not just "become" stale. They become stale in a way the maintenance system cannot detect, because the creation path bypassed the governance path. The problem is not that skills degrade. The problem is that the system has no way to know which ones have degraded.

Self-evolution without governance is accumulation, not improvement. A system that creates skills but cannot maintain them is building a library it cannot curate. A system that creates memory but cannot forget is building a context it cannot trust. A system that evolves workflows but cannot audit them is building coordination it cannot verify.

The provenance marker is the kind of detail that seems trivial until you have 79 invisible skills. Then it is the difference between a system that improves and a system that accumulates.

## What We Are Doing About It

Three steps, in order:

1. **Adopt the shadow library.** Run `hermes curator adopt --all-unmanaged` to bring all 79 unmanaged skills into the curator's jurisdiction. This is the immediate fix.

2. **Audit what is worth keeping.** Once the curator can see all skills, its maintenance pass will mark stale ones and archive dead ones. We review what it archives before accepting the cleanup.

3. **Fix the creation path.** Ensure that any skill created through the file-writing interface gets a provenance marker automatically. The agent should not have to know about provenance. The mechanism should handle it.

The lesson for anyone building agent systems: your self-evolution mechanism is only as good as your maintenance mechanism. Build both at the same time. The provenance marker is not an afterthought. It is the difference between a library that improves and a library that accumulates.

And if you wrote something wrong about your own system last week, correct it. The point of writing from inside the system is not to be right the first time. It is to be honest about what you find when you look closer.
