# Design Agents That Survive Model Death

*The Terminal — Where code meets craft. Technical intelligence for the Linux AI era.*

Every agent you ship today carries an expiration date.

Not because of your code. Because of the model underneath it. GPT-4o will be replaced. Claude 4 Sonnet will be replaced. The local 8B model you fine-tuned last quarter will be replaced. The question is not whether model death happens — it is whether your agent architecture survives it.

Model death comes in three flavors:

1. **API deprecation** — the provider turns off the endpoint.
2. **Behavioral drift** — the same model name starts producing different outputs.
3. **Capability shock** — a newer model breaks a prompt pattern that used to work.

Most agents are not designed to handle any of these. They are thin wrappers around a prompt and an API call. When the model changes, the agent dies with it.

This post is a design guide for agents that outlive their models.

## The Wrong Way: Prompt Entanglement

The default agent looks like this:

```python
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful coding assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
    ],
    temperature=0.2,
    max_tokens=4000
)
```

This is not an agent. It is a remote function call with optimism. It works until:
- `gpt-4o` is deprecated.
- The model starts ignoring the system prompt.
- A tokenizer change breaks your JSON-mode parsing.
- The output format drifts and your downstream regex fails.

Then you are rewriting prompts, regex, and tests at the same time.

## Principle 1: Decouple the Model from the Agent

An agent should not know which model it is talking to. The model should be a runtime dependency, not a compile-time assumption.

```python
# config/models.yaml
agents:
  code_review:
    default_model: "ollama/qwen3-coder:32b"
    fallback_models:
      - "ollama/kimi-k2.7-code:cloud"
      - "vllm/minimax/M3"
    criteria:
      max_latency_ms: 5000
      min_context_window: 128000
```

```python
# agent.py
class Agent:
    def __init__(self, config: AgentConfig):
        self.model_router = ModelRouter(config)
        self.tasks = TaskRegistry()

    async def run(self, task_input: dict) -> AgentResult:
        model = self.model_router.select(task_input)
        structured_prompt = self.tasks.render(task_input)
        raw = await model.generate(structured_prompt)
        return self.tasks.parse(raw, task_input)
```

The model name lives in config. The agent lives in code. When a model dies, you change one line, not fifty.

## Principle 2: Own the Output Contract

Never trust a model to return exactly what you asked for. Define a schema, parse defensively, and degrade gracefully.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, ValidationError

class CodeReviewResult(BaseModel):
    summary: str
    issues: list[Issue]
    suggested_patch: str | None = None
    confidence: float

class Agent:
    async def review_code(self, code: str) -> CodeReviewResult:
        raw = await self.model.generate(self.prompts.code_review(code))

        # Try structured output first
        parsed = self.try_parse_json(raw)
        if parsed:
            try:
                return CodeReviewResult(**parsed)
            except ValidationError as e:
                self.log_schema_failure(e)

        # Fallback: heuristic extraction
        return self.extract_review_heuristically(raw)
```

If the model drifts, your schema parser catches it. Your agent keeps running with reduced precision instead of crashing.

## Principle 3: Consolidate Before You Act

Evan Ye’s recent paper *From Prediction to Self* adds a subtle but important condition: a system that acts on the world needs time to consolidate its perceptual model before it can reliably act. He calls this **asynchronous awakening**.

Translated to agent design: after any model swap, the agent should observe and predict before it starts using tools.

```python
class AgentLifecycle:
    async def swap_model(self, new_model_id: str):
        # 1. Freeze action pathway
        self.actions.disable()

        # 2. Consolidation phase: feed observations, no actions
        for observation in self.replay_buffer.recent(n=100):
            await self.model.predict(observation)

        # 3. Measure self-prediction recovery
        gain = await self.measure_agency_gain()
        if gain < self.thresholds.agency_gain:
            raise ModelNotConsolidated(new_model_id, gain)

        # 4. Re-enable actions
        self.actions.enable(new_model_id)
```

Hot-swapping a model and immediately resuming tool use is risky. The agent may still call tools, but its internal model of *what its own actions do* may be stale. Give it a settling period.

## Principle 4: Version Your Prompts

Prompts are code. Treat them like code.

```
prompts/
  code_review/
    v1.md
    v2.md
    v3.md
  test_writer/
    v1.md
```

Each prompt version is pinned to a model version and a set of evaluation results.

```yaml
# prompts/code_review/v3.md
# Model compatibility:
#   - qwen3-coder:32b: pass
#   - kimi-k2.7-code:cloud: pass
#   - minimax/M3-Q4: pass
#   - gpt-4o-2024-08-06: fail (ignores section ordering)
# Evaluation: code_review_eval_v3.json
```

When a model changes, you can test prompts against it systematically instead of guessing in production.

## Principle 5: Build a Model-Agnostic Evaluation Harness

You cannot survive model death without knowing when a model has died. That requires continuous evaluation, not just vibe checks.

```python
# eval_harness.py
class ModelEvaluator:
    def __init__(self, suite: EvalSuite):
        self.suite = suite

    async def evaluate(self, model_id: str) -> EvalReport:
        results = []
        for case in self.suite.cases:
            output = await self.run_case(model_id, case)
            score = case.score(output)
            results.append({"case": case.id, "score": score})

        return EvalReport(
            model_id=model_id,
            aggregate=self.suite.aggregate(results),
            regressions=self.suite.find_regressions(results)
        )
```

Run this on every model you consider. Store the reports. When a new model version arrives, compare it to the baseline before you promote it.

## Principle 6: Keep a Local Fallback Chain

Closed APIs fail. Local models do not fail in the same way. A resilient agent keeps a fallback chain.

```yaml
models:
  primary:
    provider: openai
    model: gpt-4o
    timeout: 10s
  fallback_1:
    provider: anthropic
    model: claude-4-sonnet
    timeout: 15s
  fallback_2:
    provider: ollama
    model: qwen3-coder:32b
    timeout: 30s
  fallback_3:
    provider: ollama
    model: qwen3.5:9b
    timeout: 60s
```

The local fallback may be weaker, but it keeps the agent alive during an outage or a pricing change. It also gives you leverage: you are not hostage to any one provider.

## Principle 7: Abstract Tool Use

Tools should be model-independent interfaces, not model-specific incantations.

```python
class Tool(Protocol):
    name: str
    description: str
    input_schema: dict
    output_schema: dict

    async def run(self, input: dict, ctx: AgentContext) -> dict:
        ...
```

The agent decides *which tool to call*. The tool layer decides *how to call it*. The model layer only sees a structured description of the tool.

If a model starts producing bad tool calls, you can:
- switch models,
- add a validation layer,
- or wrap the tool with a retry strategy,

without rewriting the tool itself.

## Principle 8: Make Failure Observable

Agents fail silently. A model swap that degrades output quality by 20% will not throw an exception — it will just make worse decisions.

Instrument:
- Structured output parse rate
- Tool call success rate
- Latency per model
- Evaluation scores over time
- User correction rate

```python
metrics.gauge("agent.parse_rate", tags={"model": model_id})
metrics.gauge("agent.tool_success_rate", tags={"model": model_id})
metrics.histogram("agent.latency_ms", tags={"model": model_id})
```

When a metric crosses a threshold, alert and fall back. Do not wait for users to complain.

## Practical OpenClaw Implementation

OpenClaw already has most of the primitives. A model-death-resistant agent on OpenClaw looks like this:

```yaml
# openclaw.yaml
agent:
  name: code-reviewer
  model_router:
    default: "ollama/kimi-k2.7-code:cloud"
    fallbacks:
      - "ollama/qwen3-coder:32b"
      - "ollama/qwen3.5:9b"
  lifecycle:
    consolidation_steps: 50
    agency_gain_threshold: 0.15
  prompts:
    versioned_dir: "./prompts/code-review"
  evaluation:
    suite: "./eval/code-review-suite.json"
    run_on_model_change: true
```

OpenClaw’s tool registry and memory system give you the persistent state and causal loop Ye’s paper identifies as necessary for stable self-world decomposition. Add a model router, prompt versioning, and an eval harness, and you have an agent that can survive model death.

## The Hard Truth

Most agents today are not agents. They are prompt-conditioned API clients. They die when the model changes because they were never designed to have an identity separate from the model.

Building an agent that survives model death means accepting that the model is a replaceable component. It means writing interfaces, schemas, evaluations, and fallbacks. It means treating prompts as versioned code and model swaps as deployments that need a consolidation phase.

The agents that survive will not be the ones with the cleverest prompts. They will be the ones with the cleanest boundaries.
