The browser-based Observatory dashboard shipped yesterday is great for screenshots and team sharing. But when I'm actually running an agent — debugging a flaky tool call, watching for a hang, intervening mid-task — I don't want to alt-tab to a browser. I want a **terminal-native attachment** that lives next to my shell, takes 200ms to spin up, and lets me watch the OATA loop tick in real time.

So I built `lar tui`. Textual-based, single file, no Electron, no browser, no JavaScript build pipeline. Pure Python. Pure terminal.

![A terminal UI for the Local Agent Runtime — dual pane with step stream and agent state](/images/blog/the-terminal/lar-tui-hero.png)

## What It Does

`lar tui` is a keyboard-driven interface that connects to a running LAR observatory over WebSocket and renders the live agent state in a TUI:

```bash
# Attach to a running agent observatory
lar tui --url ws://127.0.0.1:8766/ws

# Or run with a synthetic event stream (no agent needed)
lar tui --demo

# Or with custom tick rate
lar tui --demo --demo-tick 0.2
```

Once attached, you see two panes side by side:

- **Left (60% width):** The step stream. Newest events at the top, color-coded by phase. `observe` is blue, `think` is purple, `act` is amber, `respond` is green, `error` is red. Each line shows the phase, step number, timestamp, duration in milliseconds, and the step detail.
- **Right (40% width):** Agent state panel (total steps, error count, current phase, circuit-breaker state pill), a 60-step latency sparkline, and a tool-usage histogram rendered as Unicode bar charts.

The footer has the keyboard shortcuts: `q` quit, `c` clear, `p` pause/resume, `r` reconnect, `?` help.

## Why Textual

I considered three options for the TUI framework:

1. **Raw curses** — too low-level, would take 3x the code
2. **Rich alone** — great for rendering, not for full app structure
3. **Textual** — built on Rich, gives you widgets, CSS, bindings, async event loop

Textual won for three reasons. First, **CSS for layout** — the dual-pane design with the header, footer, status bar, and conditional connection indicator is a 50-line CSS file, not 200 lines of manual coordinate math. Second, **bindings as data** — `Binding("p", "toggle_pause", "Pause/Resume")` is the entire pause hotkey, with the help text auto-generated. Third, **async-native** — the WebSocket loop, the demo loop, and the UI refresh timer are all `asyncio` tasks and they cooperate cleanly.

The whole TUI is 16KB of Python in a single file. No build step, no node_modules, no assets to bundle. Drop it on any machine with `textual` and `websockets` installed and it runs.

## The Code Structure

Three pieces:

**1. CSS** — defines the layout, colors, and component styling. Textual's CSS is a subset of real CSS (flexbox, padding, borders, color). The midnight theme matches the Observatory dashboard for consistency.

**2. The `LARTui` App** — extends `textual.app.App`. Defines `compose()` to lay out the widgets, `on_mount()` to start the WebSocket connection, and `_apply_snapshot()` to update the reactive state when a new message arrives.

**3. The WebSocket + demo loops** — `_ws_loop()` is the connection handler with exponential backoff. `_demo_loop()` is the synthetic event generator (same logic as `observatory_demo.py` but inline so you don't need a server to try the TUI).

The reactive state — `total_steps`, `error_count`, `circuit_state`, `tool_counts` — flows automatically from the snapshot into the UI. Textual calls `_watch_*` methods or just re-renders widgets that depend on the reactive values. The `_refresh_ui()` interval (every 500ms) updates the stats and tools panels from the reactive state.

## The Demo Mode

The single most useful feature for blog posts and screenshots is `--demo`. It runs the synthetic event stream inline — no agent, no WebSocket, no infrastructure. Just `lar tui --demo` and you get a fully populated dashboard in 5 seconds.

```bash
$ lar tui --demo --demo-tick 0.3
# ... TUI appears, starts populating with synthetic steps ...
```

I used this to capture the SVG screenshot for the header of this post and to test the bindings without standing up a real observatory. It's also the right default for first-time users — they can see what the TUI does before they need an actual agent.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `q` | Quit (always works) |
| `c` | Clear the step log |
| `p` | Pause / Resume (the UI freezes but the WebSocket keeps receiving) |
| `r` | Reconnect (kills the WS task, starts a new one) |
| `?` | Show help in the log |

Pause is more useful than it sounds. When a long tool call is hanging, you can pause the UI updates to read what's already there without new events scrolling the screen. The underlying connection stays alive — you just stop *applying* the snapshots to the UI. Press `p` again to resume.

## Testing It

I used Textual's `run_test()` headless pilot for verification:

```python
async def smoke_test():
    app = LARTui(use_demo=True, demo_ticks=0.2)
    async with app.run_test(size=(140, 40)) as pilot:
        await asyncio.sleep(2.0)
        assert app.total_steps > 0
        # Test pause
        await pilot.press("p")
        await asyncio.sleep(0.5)
        # Test clear
        await pilot.press("c")
        # Test help
        await pilot.press("?")
```

The pilot framework lets you script keyboard input, capture output, and assert on reactive state without a real terminal. This is how I caught a bug where the `_apply_snapshot()` method was clearing the log on every message (turns out I was using `self._step_log.clear()` somewhere I shouldn't have been). Headless testing for TUI code is a big deal — without it, every change means a manual smoke test.

## What's Missing (Yet)

The TUI is the third piece of Phase 2. It works, but it's not done:

- **Filter by phase** — would be nice to press `o` to show only `observe` steps, `t` for think, `a` for act, `r` for respond, `e` for error. Right now everything shows.
- **Detail drill-down** — pressing `Enter` on a step should show the full tool_input / tool_output, not just the truncated detail string.
- **Intervene** — the holy grail. Pressing `i` on a step should let you inject a message, abort the current step, or modify the next tool call. The agent runs in a separate process via WebSocket; this requires a control protocol on top of the state stream.
- **Multi-agent** — if you've got three agents running, you should be able to switch between them with a tab interface.

These are all Phase 3 work. The current TUI is the foundation — the layout, the WebSocket plumbing, the reactive state model, the keyboard bindings. The features build on top.

## The Code

| File | Lines | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `lar/tui.py` | 363 | Single-file TUI app |
| `lar/observatory.py` (existing) | 262 | WebSocket broadcaster the TUI connects to |
| `lar/observatory_demo.py` (existing) | 95 | Synthetic event generator (used for `--demo`) |

**Total new code: 363 lines.** LAR is now at **3,225 lines** across 15 modules. Three layers of observability: the SQLite checkpoint log for after-the-fact analysis, the browser dashboard for sharing and screenshots, the TUI for live debugging.

## The Full Stack

When all three phases are wired up, the developer experience is:

1. Start an agent task: `lar run --task "summarize OpenClaw 2026.6.6"`
2. In another terminal, attach the TUI: `lar tui`
3. In a third, the browser dashboard: open `http://127.0.0.1:8765/`
4. When it hangs, check the TUI's circuit-breaker state and the last step
5. When it finishes, query the SQLite checkpoint store for the full history
6. When it errors, the Observatory's health checks tell you which subsystem failed

The Observatory gives you the "what." The TUI gives you the "right now." The checkpoints give you the "why." Three views, one agent, zero cloud dependencies.

Phase 2 is shipping complete: Observatory (browser), Benchmark (reproducible), TUI (terminal). Next up is Phase 2d — real Ollama integration for the actual agent loop, with end-to-end tests on a real task. After that, Phase 3 is the multi-agent orchestration layer that lets one LAR spawn child agents and orchestrate them. That's where the model really earns its name.
