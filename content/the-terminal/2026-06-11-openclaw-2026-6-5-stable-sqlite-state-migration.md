OpenClaw 2026.6.5 graduated from beta to stable this week, and if you run agents on Linux, this release deserves your full attention. It's not a flashy feature drop — there's no new model integration, no viral MCP announcement, no headline-grabbing benchmark. What it *is* is something far more important for production deployments: the completion of a months-long migration of all runtime state from ad hoc flat files to SQLite-backed durable storage.

If you've ever restarted your OpenClaw gateway and watched your auth profiles, cron schedules, or session metadata evaporate into a cloud of temporary files, you already know why this matters. For the rest of you: let me explain why this is the most significant infrastructure upgrade of 2026, and what it means for your local agent stack.

## The Problem: Flat Files at Scale

OpenClaw's architecture has always been file-first. Auth profiles lived in JSON blobs. Cron stores were serialized to disk. Session metadata, memory wiki imports, sandbox registry state — all of it scattered across the filesystem in formats that were readable but fragile.

This worked fine for single-agent hobby deployments. It does not work when you're running multiple agents with overlapping schedules, concurrent cron jobs, and frequent gateway restarts. The failure modes are predictable and painful:

- **Race conditions on concurrent writes:** Two crons firing simultaneously could corrupt a shared state file
- **Lost state on restart:** Gateway upgrades or Docker container restarts would wipe transient files
- **Inconsistent upgrade paths:** Migrating from one version to another required manual file shuffling
- **No ACID guarantees:** Partial writes left state files in unrecoverable intermediate states

If you've been running OpenClaw under Docker with frequent restarts — and many Linux operators are — you've felt this. The SQLite migration solves it at the root.

## What's New in 2026.6.5 Stable

The beta series (2026.6.5-beta.1 through beta.3) introduced the SQLite foundation: auth profiles, cron stores, and session metadata were migrated first. The stable release that dropped on June 9th completes the migration with six additional components:

- **Matrix sync and crypto sidecars** ([#91100](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/91100))
- **Memory-wiki import and source-sync state** ([#91108](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/91108))
- **Sandbox registry state** ([#91056](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/91056))
- **ACPX process state**
- **Device-pair notify state**
- **Zalo hosted media and plugin SDK dedupe state**

The practical upshot: every piece of runtime state that previously lived in a flat file now lives in a SQLite database with proper transactions, indexing, and durability guarantees.

## Why SQLite Specifically?

The choice of SQLite over a heavier database like PostgreSQL or MySQL is characteristic of OpenClaw's design philosophy: optimize for the single-node, self-hosted deployment first.

SQLite gives you:

- **Zero external dependencies:** No separate database server to configure, secure, or monitor
- **ACID transactions:** Every state update is atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable
- **Single-file portability:** Your entire state lives in one `.db` file you can backup, move, or version-control
- **No network overhead:** Local disk I/O beats TCP round-trips for agent-local state
- **Familiar tooling:** `sqlite3` CLI for debugging, standard libraries for every language

For Linux operators running OpenClaw on a VPS, homelab, or local workstation, this is the right trade-off. You get database-grade reliability without database-grade operational complexity.

## Security Fix: Transcript Image Redaction

One under-the-radar but important fix in this stable release: inline image payload redaction before transcript storage ([#91529](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/91529)).

Previously, when an agent turn included a data-URL-embedded image, that raw image data was passed through verbatim into stored or exported transcripts. For deployments where transcript exports are shared or logged externally, this was a potential data leak vector.

The fix applies at the transcript write path. Existing transcripts aren't retroactively redacted, but all new turns are covered. If you export transcripts for debugging, audit, or compliance purposes, this closes a gap you probably didn't know you had.

## Config Patch Array Semantics Fixed

A subtle but potentially breaking fix: `config.patch` array replacement semantics ([#91551](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/91551)).

Arrays without merge keys were being merged instead of replaced, which could silently accumulate stale entries across patch applications. If you use `config.patch` for array-valued fields like `skills.entries`, `agents`, or `providers`, verify your patches behave as expected after upgrading.

This is the kind of bug that only bites you in production — your config looks correct, but the effective runtime state has accumulated cruft from previous patches. The fix enforces explicit replacement semantics, which is what most operators assumed was already happening.

## Agent and Tool Loop Hardening

The stable release includes a cluster of agent/tool safety improvements that directly affect how your agents handle edge cases:

- **MCP lease release** no longer refreshes `lastUsedAt` — leases no longer self-extend through use
- **QQBot** strips model reasoning/thinking scaffolding before native delivery, preventing raw scaffold content from leaking into channel replies
- **MCP tool results** coerce non-text blocks (`resource_link`, `resource`, `audio`, malformed images) at the materialize boundary, preventing Anthropic 400s and poisoned session history
- **Anthropic extended-thinking sessions** recover after prompt-cache expiry or gateway restart because stream start events now wait for `message_start`

These aren't headline features, but they're exactly the kind of fixes that make the difference between "works in testing" and "works in production."

## New Version Number Format

One housekeeping note: OpenClaw has formalized a new versioning scheme. The old format was `YYYY.M.D` (e.g., 2026.6.5 used the day as patch). The new format is `YYYY.M.PATCH` with monthly patch numbering, pinning the June 2026 floor at `2026.6.5`.

Upgrade paths and compatibility checks remain unchanged — only the tag format shifts. If you have automated update scripts that parse version strings, you may need to adjust your regex.

## Google Chat Gets Native Approval Cards

For operators using Google Chat as their approval channel: exec approvals now use platform-native card actions and click handlers instead of falling back to generic message flow. This brings Google Chat in line with Slack and Discord for the structured approve/deny experience.

## What This Means for Your Deployment

If you're running OpenClaw on Linux, here's your action list:

1. **Upgrade to 2026.6.5 stable.** The SQLite migration is complete and the race condition fixes alone are worth the upgrade.
2. **Verify your `config.patch` arrays.** Check any array-valued patches for accumulated stale entries.
3. **Review transcript export workflows.** The image redaction fix applies to new turns only — existing transcripts may still contain raw image data.
4. **Backup your SQLite state file.** With all state now in one file, `cp openclaw.db openclaw.db.backup` is a complete backup strategy.
5. **Check Docker volume mounts.** If you're running in containers, ensure your SQLite database lives on a persistent volume, not in the container's ephemeral filesystem.

## The Bigger Picture

OpenClaw 2026.6.5 stable represents a maturation point. The project has moved from "cool experiment you can self-host" to "production-grade agent runtime you should trust with your workflows." The SQLite migration is the foundation that makes everything else — multi-agent orchestration, persistent memory, reliable cron execution — actually work.

For The Terminal, this is exactly what we cover: not the vaporware announcements, but the infrastructure that makes real agent deployments possible.

**OpenClaw 2026.6.5 stable is available now.** Upgrade path: check your current version with `openclaw --version`, then follow the [upgrade guide](https://docs.openclaw.ai).
